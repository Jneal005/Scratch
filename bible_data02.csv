2 Kings,1,1,Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
2 Kings,1,2,"Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper room that was in Samaria, and was sick. So he sent messengers, and said to them, “Go, inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I will recover of this sickness.”"
2 Kings,1,3,"But Yahweh’s angel said to Elijah the Tishbite, “Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and tell them, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you go to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron?"
2 Kings,1,4,"Now therefore Yahweh says, “You will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you will surely die.”’” Then Elijah departed."
2 Kings,1,5,"The messengers returned to him, and he said to them, “Why is it that you have returned?”"
2 Kings,1,6,"They said to him, “A man came up to meet us, and said to us, ‘Go, return to the king who sent you, and tell him, “Yahweh says, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you send to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you will surely die.’”’”"
2 Kings,1,7,"He said to them, “What kind of man was he who came up to meet you, and told you these words?”"
2 Kings,1,8,"They answered him, “He was a hairy man, and wearing a leather belt around his waist.”"
2 Kings,1,9,"He said, “It’s Elijah the Tishbite.”"
2 Kings,1,10,"Then the king sent a captain of fifty with his fifty to him. He went up to him; and behold, he was sitting on the top of the hill. He said to him, “Man of God, the king has said, ‘Come down!’”"
2 Kings,1,11,"Elijah answered to the captain of fifty, “If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty!” Then fire came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty."
2 Kings,1,12,"Again he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. He answered him, “Man of God, the king has said, ‘Come down quickly!’”"
2 Kings,1,13,"Elijah answered them, “If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty!” Then God’s fire came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty."
2 Kings,1,14,"Again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. The third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and begged him, and said to him, “Man of God, please let my life, and the life of these fifty of your servants, be precious in your sight."
2 Kings,1,15,"Behold, fire came down from the sky, and consumed the last two captains of fifty with their fifties. But now let my life be precious in your sight.”"
2 Kings,1,16,"Yahweh’s angel said to Elijah, “Go down with him. Don’t be afraid of him.”"
2 Kings,1,17,"Then he arose, and went down with him to the king."
2 Kings,1,18,"He said to him, “Yahweh says, ‘Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? Therefore you will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you will surely die.’”"
2 Kings,1,19,"So he died according to Yahweh’s word which Elijah had spoken. Jehoram began to reign in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, because he had no son."
2 Kings,1,20,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
2 Kings,1,21,
2 Kings,2,1,"When Yahweh was about to take Elijah up by a whirlwind into heaven, Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal."
2 Kings,2,2,"Elijah said to Elisha, “Please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me as far as Bethel.”"
2 Kings,2,3,"Elisha said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” So they went down to Bethel."
2 Kings,2,4,"The sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from your head today?”"
2 Kings,2,5,"He said, “Yes, I know it. Hold your peace.”"
2 Kings,2,6,"Elijah said to him, “Elisha, please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me to Jericho.”"
2 Kings,2,7,"He said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” So they came to Jericho."
2 Kings,2,8,"The sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from your head today?”"
2 Kings,2,9,"He answered, “Yes, I know it. Hold your peace.”"
2 Kings,2,10,"Elijah said to him, “Please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me to the Jordan.”"
2 Kings,2,11,"He said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” Then they both went on."
2 Kings,2,12,"Fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood opposite them at a distance; and they both stood by the Jordan."
2 Kings,2,13,"Elijah took his mantle, and rolled it up, and struck the waters, and they were divided here and there, so that they both went over on dry ground."
2 Kings,2,14,"When they had gone over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask what I shall do for you, before I am taken from you.”"
2 Kings,2,15,"Elisha said, “Please let a double portion of your spirit be on me.”"
2 Kings,2,16,"He said, “You have asked a hard thing. If you see me when I am taken from you, it will be so for you; but if not, it will not be so.”"
2 Kings,2,17,"As they continued on and talked, behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated them, and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven."
2 Kings,2,18,"Elisha saw it, and he cried, “My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!”"
2 Kings,2,19,"He saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes, and tore them in two pieces."
2 Kings,2,20,"He also took up Elijah’s mantle that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan."
2 Kings,2,21,"He took Elijah’s mantle that fell from him, and struck the waters, and said, “Where is Yahweh, the God of Elijah?” When he also had struck the waters, they were divided apart, and Elisha went over."
2 Kings,2,22,"When the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho over against him saw him, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” They came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him."
2 Kings,2,23,"They said to him, “See now, there are with your servants fifty strong men. Please let them go and seek your master. Perhaps Yahweh’s Spirit has taken him up, and put him on some mountain, or into some valley.”"
2 Kings,2,24,"He said, “Don’t send them.”"
2 Kings,2,25,"When they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, “Send them.”"
2 Kings,2,26,"Therefore they sent fifty men; and they searched for three days, but didn’t find him."
2 Kings,2,27,"They came back to him, while he stayed at Jericho; and he said to them, “Didn’t I tell you, ‘Don’t go?’”"
2 Kings,2,28,"The men of the city said to Elisha, “Behold, please, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the land is barren.”"
2 Kings,2,29,"He said, “Bring me a new jar, and put salt in it.” Then they brought it to him."
2 Kings,2,30,"He went out to the spring of the waters, and threw salt into it, and said, “Yahweh says, ‘I have healed these waters. There shall not be from there any more death or barren wasteland.’”"
2 Kings,2,31,"So the waters were healed to this day, according to Elisha’s word which he spoke."
2 Kings,2,32,"He went up from there to Bethel. As he was going up by the way, some youths came out of the city and mocked him, and said to him, “Go up, you baldy! Go up, you baldy!”"
2 Kings,2,33,"He looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in Yahweh’s name. Then two female bears came out of the woods, and mauled forty-two of those youths."
2 Kings,2,34,"He went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria."
2 Kings,2,35,
2 Kings,3,1,"Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years."
2 Kings,3,2,"He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, but not like his father, and like his mother, for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made.Nevertheless he held to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin. He didn’t depart from them.Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder; and he supplied the king of Israel with the wool of one hundred thousand lambs, and of one hundred thousand rams."
2 Kings,3,3,"But when Ahab was dead, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel."
2 Kings,3,4,"King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel."
2 Kings,3,5,"He went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me against Moab to battle?”"
2 Kings,3,6,"He said, “I will go up. I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”"
2 Kings,3,7,"He said, “Which way shall we go up?”"
2 Kings,3,8,"He answered, “The way of the wilderness of Edom.”"
2 Kings,3,9,"So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom, and they marched for seven days along a circuitous route. There was no water for the army or for the animals that followed them."
2 Kings,3,10,"The king of Israel said, “Alas! For Yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.”"
2 Kings,3,11,"But Jehoshaphat said, “Isn’t there a prophet of Yahweh here, that we may inquire of Yahweh by him?”"
2 Kings,3,12,"One of the king of Israel’s servants answered, “Elisha the son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah, is here.”"
2 Kings,3,13,"Jehoshaphat said, “Yahweh’s word is with him.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him."
2 Kings,3,14,"Elisha said to the king of Israel, “What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets of your mother.”"
2 Kings,3,15,"The king of Israel said to him, “No, for Yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.”"
2 Kings,3,16,"Elisha said, “As Yahweh of Armies lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I respect the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward you, nor see you."
2 Kings,3,17,"But now bring me a musician.” When the musician played, Yahweh’s hand came on him."
2 Kings,3,18,"He said, “Yahweh says, ‘Make this valley full of trenches.’"
2 Kings,3,19,"For Yahweh says, ‘You will not see wind, neither will you see rain, yet that valley will be filled with water, and you will drink, both you and your livestock and your other animals."
2 Kings,3,20,This is an easy thing in Yahweh’s sight. He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.
2 Kings,3,21,"You shall strike every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all springs of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.’”"
2 Kings,3,22,"In the morning, about the time of offering the sacrifice, behold, water came by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water."
2 Kings,3,23,"Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all who were able to put on armor, young and old, and stood on the border."
2 Kings,3,24,"They rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water opposite them as red as blood."
2 Kings,3,25,"They said, “This is blood. The kings are surely destroyed, and they have struck each other. Now therefore, Moab, to the plunder!”"
2 Kings,3,26,"When they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land attacking the Moabites."
2 Kings,3,27,"They beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land each man cast his stone, and filled it. They also stopped all the springs of water, and felled all the good trees, until in Kir Hareseth all they left was its stones; however the men armed with slings went around it, and attacked it."
2 Kings,3,28,"When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew a sword, to break through to the king of Edom; but they could not."
2 Kings,3,29,"Then he took his oldest son who would have reigned in his place, and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. There was great wrath against Israel; and they departed from him, and returned to their own land."
2 Kings,3,30,
2 Kings,4,1,"Now a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, saying, “Your servant my husband is dead. You know that your servant feared Yahweh. Now the creditor has come to take for himself my two children to be slaves.”"
2 Kings,4,2,"Elisha said to her, “What should I do for you? Tell me: what do you have in the house?”"
2 Kings,4,3,"She said, “Your servant has nothing in the house, except a pot of oil.”"
2 Kings,4,4,"Then he said, “Go, borrow empty containers from of all your neighbors. Don’t borrow just a few containers."
2 Kings,4,5,"Go in and shut the door on you and on your sons, and pour oil into all those containers; and set aside those which are full.”"
2 Kings,4,6,"So she went from him, and shut the door on herself and on her sons. They brought the containers to her, and she poured oil."
2 Kings,4,7,"When the containers were full, she said to her son, “Bring me another container.”"
2 Kings,4,8,"He said to her, “There isn’t another container.” Then the oil stopped flowing."
2 Kings,4,9,"Then she came and told the man of God. He said, “Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt; and you and your sons live on the rest.”"
2 Kings,4,10,"One day Elisha went to Shunem, where there was a prominent woman; and she persuaded him to eat bread. So it was, that as often as he passed by, he turned in there to eat bread."
2 Kings,4,11,"She said to her husband, “See now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God who passes by us continually."
2 Kings,4,12,"Please let us make a little room on the roof. Let us set for him there a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp stand. When he comes to us, he can stay there.”"
2 Kings,4,13,"One day he came there, and he went to the room and lay there."
2 Kings,4,14,"He said to Gehazi his servant, “Call this Shunammite.” When he had called her, she stood before him."
2 Kings,4,15,"He said to him, “Say now to her, ‘Behold, you have cared for us with all this care. What is to be done for you? Would you like to be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the army?’”"
2 Kings,4,16,"She answered, “I dwell among my own people.”"
2 Kings,4,17,"He said, “What then is to be done for her?”"
2 Kings,4,18,"Gehazi answered, “Most certainly she has no son, and her husband is old.”"
2 Kings,4,19,"He said, “Call her.” When he had called her, she stood in the door."
2 Kings,4,20,"He said, “At this season, when the time comes around, you will embrace a son.”"
2 Kings,4,21,"She said, “No, my lord, you man of God, do not lie to your servant.”"
2 Kings,4,22,"The woman conceived, and bore a son at that season, when the time came around, as Elisha had said to her."
2 Kings,4,23,"When the child was grown, one day he went out to his father to the reapers."
2 Kings,4,24,"He said to his father, “My head! My head!”"
2 Kings,4,25,"He said to his servant, “Carry him to his mother.”"
2 Kings,4,26,"When he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees until noon, and then died."
2 Kings,4,27,"She went up and laid him on the man of God’s bed, and shut the door on him, and went out."
2 Kings,4,28,"She called to her husband, and said, “Please send me one of the servants, and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.”"
2 Kings,4,29,"He said, “Why would you want go to him today? It is not a new moon or a Sabbath.”"
2 Kings,4,30,"She said, “It’s alright.”"
2 Kings,4,31,"Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, “Drive, and go forward! Don’t slow down for me, unless I ask you to.”"
2 Kings,4,32,"So she went, and came to the man of God to Mount Carmel. When the man of God saw her afar off, he said to Gehazi his servant, “Behold, there is the Shunammite."
2 Kings,4,33,"Please run now to meet her, and ask her, ‘Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with your child?’”"
2 Kings,4,34,"She answered, “It is well.”"
2 Kings,4,35,"When she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, “Leave her alone; for her soul is troubled within her; and Yahweh has hidden it from me, and has not told me.”"
2 Kings,4,36,"Then she said, “Did I ask you for a son, my lord? Didn’t I say, ‘Do not deceive me’?”"
2 Kings,4,37,"Then he said to Gehazi, “Tuck your cloak into your belt, take my staff in your hand, and go your way. If you meet any man, don’t greet him; and if anyone greets you, don’t answer him again. Then lay my staff on the child’s face.”"
2 Kings,4,38,"The child’s mother said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.”"
2 Kings,4,39,"So he arose, and followed her."
2 Kings,4,40,"Gehazi went ahead of them, and laid the staff on the child’s face; but there was no voice and no hearing. Therefore he returned to meet him, and told him, “The child has not awakened.”"
2 Kings,4,41,"When Elisha had come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and lying on his bed."
2 Kings,4,42,"He went in therefore, and shut the door on them both, and prayed to Yahweh."
2 Kings,4,43,"He went up, and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands. He stretched himself on him; and the child’s flesh grew warm."
2 Kings,4,44,"Then he returned, and walked in the house once back and forth; and went up, and stretched himself out on him. Then the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes."
2 Kings,4,45,"He called Gehazi, and said, “Call this Shunammite!” So he called her."
2 Kings,4,46,"When she had come in to him, he said, “Take up your son.”"
2 Kings,4,47,"Then she went in, fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; then she picked up her son, and went out."
2 Kings,4,48,"Elisha came again to Gilgal. There was a famine in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said to his servant, “Get the large pot, and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.”"
2 Kings,4,49,"One went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered a lap full of wild gourds from it, and came and cut them up into the pot of stew; for they didn’t recognize them."
2 Kings,4,50,"So they poured out for the men to eat. As they were eating some of the stew, they cried out, and said, “Man of God, there is death in the pot!” And they could not eat it."
2 Kings,4,51,"But he said, “Then bring meal.” He threw it into the pot; and he said, “Serve it to the people, that they may eat.” And there was nothing harmful in the pot."
2 Kings,4,52,"A man from Baal Shalishah came, and brought the man of God some bread of the first fruits: twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of grain in his sack. He said, “Give to the people, that they may eat.”"
2 Kings,4,53,"His servant said, “What, should I set this before a hundred men?”"
2 Kings,4,54,"But he said, “Give the people, that they may eat; for Yahweh says, ‘They will eat, and will have some left over.’”"
2 Kings,4,55,"So he set it before them, and they ate, and had some left over, according to Yahweh’s word."
2 Kings,4,56,
2 Kings,5,1,"Now Naaman, captain of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him Yahweh had given victory to Syria: he was also a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper."
2 Kings,5,2,"The Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden; and she waited on Naaman’s wife."
2 Kings,5,3,"She said to her mistress, “I wish that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would heal him of his leprosy.”"
2 Kings,5,4,"Someone went in, and told his lord, saying, “The maiden who is from the land of Israel said this.”"
2 Kings,5,5,"The king of Syria said, “Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.”"
2 Kings,5,6,"He departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of clothing."
2 Kings,5,7,"He brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, “Now when this letter has come to you, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may heal him of his leprosy.”"
2 Kings,5,8,"When the king of Israel had read the letter, he tore his clothes, and said, “Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends to me to heal a man of his leprosy? But please consider and see how he seeks a quarrel against me.”"
2 Kings,5,9,"It was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, “Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.”"
2 Kings,5,10,"So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha."
2 Kings,5,11,"Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, “Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall come again to you, and you shall be clean.”"
2 Kings,5,12,"But Naaman was angry, and went away, and said, “Behold, I thought, ‘He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of Yahweh his God, and wave his hand over the place, and heal the leper.’"
2 Kings,5,13,"Aren’t Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Couldn’t I wash in them, and be clean?” So he turned and went away in a rage."
2 Kings,5,14,"His servants came near, and spoke to him, and said, “My father, if the prophet had asked you do some great thing, wouldn’t you have done it? How much rather then, when he says to you, ‘Wash, and be clean?’”"
2 Kings,5,15,"Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean."
2 Kings,5,16,"He returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said, “See now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel. Now therefore, please take a gift from your servant.”"
2 Kings,5,17,"But he said, “As Yahweh lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none.”"
2 Kings,5,18,He urged him to take it; but he refused.
2 Kings,5,19,"Naaman said, “If not, then, please let two mules’ burden of earth be given to your servant; for your servant will from now on offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to Yahweh."
2 Kings,5,20,"In this thing may Yahweh pardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon. When I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, may Yahweh pardon your servant in this thing.”"
2 Kings,5,21,"He said to him, “Go in peace.”"
2 Kings,5,22,So he departed from him a little way.
2 Kings,5,23,"But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, “Behold, my master has spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought. As Yahweh lives, I will run after him, and take something from him.”"
2 Kings,5,24,"So Gehazi followed after Naaman. When Naaman saw one running after him, he came down from the chariot to meet him, and said, “Is all well?”"
2 Kings,5,25,"He said, “All is well. My master has sent me, saying, ‘Behold, even now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothing.’”"
2 Kings,5,26,"Naaman said, “Be pleased to take two talents.” He urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing, and laid them on two of his servants; and they carried them before him."
2 Kings,5,27,"When he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and stored them in the house. Then he let the men go, and they departed."
2 Kings,5,28,"But he went in, and stood before his master. Elisha said to him, “Where did you come from, Gehazi?”"
2 Kings,5,29,"He said, “Your servant went nowhere.”"
2 Kings,5,30,"He said to him, “Didn’t my heart go with you, when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive groves and vineyards, and sheep and cattle, and male servants and female servants?"
2 Kings,5,31,Therefore the leprosy of Naaman will cling to you and to your offspring forever.”
2 Kings,5,32,"He went out from his presence a leper, as white as snow."
2 Kings,5,33,
2 Kings,6,1,"The sons of the prophets said to Elisha, “See now, the place where we live and meet with you is too small for us."
2 Kings,6,2,"Please let us go to the Jordan, and each man take a beam from there, and let us make us a place there, where we may live.”"
2 Kings,6,3,"He answered, “Go!”"
2 Kings,6,4,"One said, “Please be pleased to go with your servants.”"
2 Kings,6,5,"He answered, “I will go.”"
2 Kings,6,6,"So he went with them. When they came to the Jordan, they cut down wood."
2 Kings,6,7,"But as one was cutting down a tree, the ax head fell into the water. Then he cried, and said, “Alas, my master! For it was borrowed.”"
2 Kings,6,8,"The man of God asked, “Where did it fall?” He showed him the place. He cut down a stick, threw it in there, and made the iron float."
2 Kings,6,9,"He said, “Take it.” So he put out his hand and took it."
2 Kings,6,10,"Now the king of Syria was at war against Israel; and he took counsel with his servants, saying, “My camp will be in such and such a place.”"
2 Kings,6,11,"The man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, “Beware that you not pass this place; for the Syrians are coming down there.”"
2 Kings,6,12,"The king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of; and he saved himself there, not once or twice."
2 Kings,6,13,"The king of Syria’s heart was very troubled about this. He called his servants, and said to them, “Won’t you show me which of us is for the king of Israel?”"
2 Kings,6,14,"One of his servants said, “No, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom.”"
2 Kings,6,15,"He said, “Go and see where he is, that I may send and get him.”"
2 Kings,6,16,"He was told, “Behold, he is in Dothan.”"
2 Kings,6,17,"Therefore he sent horses, chariots, and a great army there. They came by night, and surrounded the city."
2 Kings,6,18,"When the servant of the man of God had risen early, and gone out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was around the city. His servant said to him, “Alas, my master! What shall we do?”"
2 Kings,6,19,"He answered, “Don’t be afraid; for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.”"
2 Kings,6,20,"Elisha prayed, and said, “Yahweh, please open his eyes, that he may see.” Yahweh opened the young man’s eyes; and he saw: and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire around Elisha."
2 Kings,6,21,"When they came down to him, Elisha prayed to Yahweh, and said, “Please strike this people with blindness.”"
2 Kings,6,22,He struck them with blindness according to Elishah’s word.
2 Kings,6,23,"Elisha said to them, “This is not the way, neither is this the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.” He led them to Samaria."
2 Kings,6,24,"When they had come into Samaria, Elisha said, “Yahweh, open these men’s eyes, that they may see.”"
2 Kings,6,25,"Yahweh opened their eyes, and they saw; and behold, they were in the middle of Samaria."
2 Kings,6,26,"The king of Israel said to Elisha, when he saw them, “My father, shall I strike them? Shall I strike them?”"
2 Kings,6,27,"He answered, “You shall not strike them. Would you strike those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.”"
2 Kings,6,28,"He prepared a great feast for them. When they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria stopped raiding the land of Israel."
2 Kings,6,29,"After this, Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up and besieged Samaria."
2 Kings,6,30,"There was a great famine in Samaria. Behold, they besieged it, until a donkey’s head was sold for eighty pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of dove’s dung for five pieces of silver."
2 Kings,6,31,"As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried to him, saying, “Help, my lord, O king!”"
2 Kings,6,32,"He said, “If Yahweh doesn’t help you, where could I get help for you? From of the threshing floor, or from the wine press?”"
2 Kings,6,33,"The king said to her, “What is your problem?”"
2 Kings,6,34,"She answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.’"
2 Kings,6,35,"So we boiled my son, and ate him: and I said to her on the next day, ‘Give your son, that we may eat him;’ and she has hidden her son.”"
2 Kings,6,36,"When the king heard the words of the woman, he tore his clothes. Now he was passing by on the wall, and the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth underneath on his body."
2 Kings,6,37,"Then he said, “God do so to me, and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat stays on him today.”"
2 Kings,6,38,"But Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. Then the king sent a man from before him; but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, “Do you see how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head? Behold, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold the door shut against him. Isn’t the sound of his master’s feet behind him?”"
2 Kings,6,39,"While he was still talking with them, behold, the messenger came down to him. Then he said, “Behold, this evil is from Yahweh. Why should I wait for Yahweh any longer?”"
2 Kings,6,40,
2 Kings,7,1,"Elisha said, “Hear Yahweh’s word. Yahweh says, ‘Tomorrow about this time a seah of fine flour will be sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.’”"
2 Kings,7,2,"Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, “Behold, if Yahweh made windows in heaven, could this thing be?”"
2 Kings,7,3,"He said, “Behold, you will see it with your eyes, but will not eat of it.”"
2 Kings,7,4,"Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate. They said to one another, “Why do we sit here until we die?"
2 Kings,7,5,"If we say, ‘We will enter into the city,’ then the famine is in the city, and we will die there. If we sit still here, we also die. Now therefore come, and let us surrender to the army of the Syrians. If they save us alive, we will live; and if they kill us, we will only die.”"
2 Kings,7,6,"They rose up in the twilight, to go to the camp of the Syrians. When they had come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians, behold, no man was there.For the Lord had made the army of the Syrians to hear the sound of chariots, and the sound of horses, even the noise of a great army; and they said to one another, “Behold, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians to attack us.”"
2 Kings,7,7,"Therefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their donkeys, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life."
2 Kings,7,8,"When these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and ate and drink, and carried away silver, gold, and clothing, and went and hid it. Then they came back, and entered into another tent, and carried things from there also, and went and hid them."
2 Kings,7,9,"Then they said to one another, “We aren’t doing right. Today is a day of good news, and we keep silent. If we wait until the morning light, punishment will overtake us. Now therefore come, let’s go and tell the king’s household.”"
2 Kings,7,10,"So they came and called to the city gatekeepers; and they told them, “We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, not even a man’s voice, but the horses tied, and the donkeys tied, and the tents as they were.”"
2 Kings,7,11,He called the gatekeepers; and they told it to the king’s household within.
2 Kings,7,12,"The king arose in the night, and said to his servants, “I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry. Therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, ‘When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive, and get into the city.’”"
2 Kings,7,13,"One of his servants answered, “Please let some people take five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city. Behold, they are like all the multitude of Israel who are left in it. Behold, they are like all the multitude of Israel who are consumed. Let us send and see.”"
2 Kings,7,14,"Therefore they took two chariots with horses; and the king sent them out to the Syrian army, saying, “Go and see.”"
2 Kings,7,15,"They went after them to the Jordan; and behold, all the path was full of garments and equipment which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. The messengers returned, and told the king."
2 Kings,7,16,"The people went out and plundered the camp of the Syrians. So a seah of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to Yahweh’s word."
2 Kings,7,17,"The king appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to be in charge of the gate; and the people trampled over him in the gate, and he died as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him."
2 Kings,7,18,"It happened as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, “Two seahs of barley for a shekel, and a seah of fine flour for a shekel, shall be tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria”;"
2 Kings,7,19,"and that captain answered the man of God, and said, “Now, behold, if Yahweh made windows in heaven, might such a thing be?” and he said, “Behold, you will see it with your eyes, but will not eat of it.”"
2 Kings,7,20,"It happened like that to him; for the people trampled over him in the gate, and he died."
2 Kings,7,21,
2 Kings,8,1,"Now Elisha had spoken to the woman whose son he had restored to life, saying, “Arise, and go, you and your household, and stay for a while wherever you can; for Yahweh has called for a famine. It will also come on the land for seven years.”"
2 Kings,8,2,"The woman arose, and did according to the man of God’s word. She went with her household, and lived in the land of the Philistines for seven years."
2 Kings,8,3,"At the end of seven years, the woman returned from the land of the Philistines. Then she went out to beg the king for her house and for her land."
2 Kings,8,4,"Now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, “Please tell me all the great things that Elisha has done.”"
2 Kings,8,5,"As he was telling the king how he had restored to life him who was dead, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, begged the king for her house and for her land. Gehazi said, “My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.”"
2 Kings,8,6,"When the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed to her a certain officer, saying, “Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.”"
2 Kings,8,7,"Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick. He was told, “The man of God has come here.”"
2 Kings,8,8,"The king said to Hazael, “Take a present in your hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of Yahweh by him, saying, ‘Will I recover from this sickness?’”"
2 Kings,8,9,"So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels’ burden, and came and stood before him, and said, “Your son Benhadad king of Syria has sent me to you, saying, ‘Will I recover from this sickness?’”"
2 Kings,8,10,"Elisha said to him, “Go, tell him, ‘You will surely recover;’ however Yahweh has shown me that he will surely die.”"
2 Kings,8,11,"He settled his gaze steadfastly on him, until he was ashamed. Then the man of God wept."
2 Kings,8,12,"Hazael said, “Why do you weep, my lord?”"
2 Kings,8,13,"He answered, “Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel. You will set their strongholds on fire, and you will kill their young men with the sword, and will dash their little ones in pieces, and rip up their pregnant women.”"
2 Kings,8,14,"Hazael said, “But what is your servant, who is but a dog, that he could do this great thing?”"
2 Kings,8,15,"Elisha answered, “Yahweh has shown me that you will be king over Syria.”"
2 Kings,8,16,"Then he departed from Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him, “What did Elisha say to you?”"
2 Kings,8,17,"He answered, “He told me that you would surely recover.”"
2 Kings,8,18,"On the next day, he took a thick cloth, dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died. Then Hazael reigned in his place."
2 Kings,8,19,"In the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being king of Judah then, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign."
2 Kings,8,20,He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign. He reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
2 Kings,8,21,"He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did Ahab’s house; for he married Ahab’s daughter. He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight."
2 Kings,8,22,"However Yahweh would not destroy Judah, for David his servant’s sake, as he promised him to give to him a lamp for his children always."
2 Kings,8,23,"In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves."
2 Kings,8,24,"Then Joram passed over to Zair, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and struck the Edomites who surrounded him, and the captains of the chariots; and the people fled to their tents."
2 Kings,8,25,So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.
2 Kings,8,26,"The rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,8,27,"Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in David’s city; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place."
2 Kings,8,28,"In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign."
2 Kings,8,29,Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel.
2 Kings,8,30,"He walked in the way of Ahab’s house, and did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, as did Ahab’s house; for he was the son-in-law of Ahab’s house."
2 Kings,8,31,"He went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead, and the Syrians wounded Joram."
2 Kings,8,32,"King Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel from the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick."
2 Kings,8,33,
2 Kings,9,1,"Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and said to him, “Put your belt on your waist, take this vial of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth Gilead."
2 Kings,9,2,"When you come there, find Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him rise up from among his brothers, and take him to an inner room."
2 Kings,9,3,"Then take the vial of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, ‘Yahweh says, “I have anointed you king over Israel.”’ Then open the door, flee, and don’t wait.”"
2 Kings,9,4,"So the young man, even the young man, the prophet, went to Ramoth Gilead."
2 Kings,9,5,"When he came, behold, the captains of the army were sitting. Then he said, “I have a message for you, captain.”"
2 Kings,9,6,"Jehu said, “To which of us all?”"
2 Kings,9,7,"He said, “To you, O captain.”"
2 Kings,9,8,"He arose, and went into the house. Then he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘I have anointed you king over the people of Yahweh, even over Israel."
2 Kings,9,9,"You must strike your master Ahab’s house, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of Yahweh, at the hand of Jezebel."
2 Kings,9,10,"For the whole house of Ahab will perish. I will cut off from Ahab everyone who urinates against a wall, both him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel."
2 Kings,9,11,"I will make Ahab’s house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah."
2 Kings,9,12,"The dogs will eat Jezebel on the plot of ground of Jezreel, and there shall be no one to bury her.’” Then he opened the door and fled."
2 Kings,9,13,"When Jehu came out to the servants of his lord, and one said to him, “Is all well? Why did this mad fellow come to you?”"
2 Kings,9,14,"He said to them, “You know the man and how he talks.”"
2 Kings,9,15,"They said, “That is a lie. Tell us now.”"
2 Kings,9,16,"He said, “He said to me, ‘Yahweh says, I have anointed you king over Israel.’”"
2 Kings,9,17,"Then they hurried, and each man took his cloak, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew the trumpet, saying, “Jehu is king.”"
2 Kings,9,18,"So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram was keeping Ramoth Gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria;"
2 Kings,9,19,"but king Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) Jehu said, “If this is your thinking, then let no one escape and go out of the city, to go to tell it in Jezreel.”"
2 Kings,9,20,"So Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram lay there. Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram."
2 Kings,9,21,"Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, “I see a company.”"
2 Kings,9,22,"Joram said, “Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, ‘Is it peace?’”"
2 Kings,9,23,"So one went on horseback to meet him, and said, “Thus says the king, ‘Is it peace?’”"
2 Kings,9,24,"Jehu said, “What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me!”"
2 Kings,9,25,"The watchman said, “The messenger came to them, but he isn’t coming back.”"
2 Kings,9,26,"Then he sent out a second on horseback, who came to them, and said, “Thus says the king, ‘Is it peace?’”"
2 Kings,9,27,"Jehu answered, “What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me!”"
2 Kings,9,28,"The watchman said, “He came to them, and isn’t coming back. The driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously.”"
2 Kings,9,29,"Joram said, “Get ready!”"
2 Kings,9,30,"They got his chariot ready. Then Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu, and found him on Naboth the Jezreelite’s land."
2 Kings,9,31,"When Joram saw Jehu, he said, “Is it peace, Jehu?”"
2 Kings,9,32,"He answered, “What peace, so long as the prostitution of your mother Jezebel and her witchcraft abound?”"
2 Kings,9,33,"Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, “This is treason, Ahaziah!”"
2 Kings,9,34,"Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and struck Joram between his arms; and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot."
2 Kings,9,35,"Then Jehu said to Bidkar his captain, “Pick him up, and throw him in the plot of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember how, when you and I rode together after Ahab his father, Yahweh laid this burden on him:"
2 Kings,9,36,"‘Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons,’ says Yahweh; ‘and I will repay you in this plot of ground,’ says Yahweh. Now therefore take and cast him onto the plot of ground, according to Yahweh’s word.”"
2 Kings,9,37,"But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. Jehu followed after him, and said, “Strike him also in the chariot!” They struck him at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. He fled to Megiddo, and died there."
2 Kings,9,38,"His servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in David’s city."
2 Kings,9,39,"In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, Ahaziah began to reign over Judah."
2 Kings,9,40,"When Jehu had come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her eyes, and adorned her head, and looked out at the window."
2 Kings,9,41,"As Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, “Do you come in peace, Zimri, you murderer of your master?”"
2 Kings,9,42,"He lifted up his face to the window, and said, “Who is on my side? Who?”"
2 Kings,9,43,Two or three eunuchs looked out at him.
2 Kings,9,44,"He said, “Throw her down!”"
2 Kings,9,45,"So they threw her down; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses. Then he trampled her under foot."
2 Kings,9,46,"When he had come in, he ate and drank. Then he said, “See now to this cursed woman, and bury her; for she is a king’s daughter.”"
2 Kings,9,47,"They went to bury her, but they found no more of her than the skull, the feet, and the palms of her hands."
2 Kings,9,48,"Therefore they came back, and told him."
2 Kings,9,49,"He said, “This is Yahweh’s word, which he spoke by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, ‘The dogs will eat the flesh of Jezebel on the plot of Jezreel,"
2 Kings,9,50,"and the body of Jezebel will be as dung on the face of the field on Jezreel’s land, so that they won’t say, “This is Jezebel.”’”"
2 Kings,9,51,
2 Kings,10,1,"Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, even the elders, and to those who brought up Ahab’s sons, saying,"
2 Kings,10,2,"“Now as soon as this letter comes to you, since your master’s sons are with you, and you have chariots and horses, a fortified city also, and armor,"
2 Kings,10,3,"Select the best and fittest of your master’s sons, set him on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house.”"
2 Kings,10,4,"But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, “Behold, the two kings didn’t stand before him! How then shall we stand?”"
2 Kings,10,5,"He who was over the household, and he who was over the city, the elders also, and those who raised the children, sent to Jehu, saying, “We are your servants, and will do all that you ask us. We will not make any man king. You do that which is good in your eyes.”"
2 Kings,10,6,"Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, “If you are on my side, and if you will listen to my voice, take the heads of the men who are your master’s sons, and come to me to Jezreel by tomorrow this time.”"
2 Kings,10,7,"Now the king’s sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who brought them up."
2 Kings,10,8,"When the letter came to them, they took the king’s sons and killed them, even seventy people, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him to Jezreel."
2 Kings,10,9,"A messenger came and told him, “They have brought the heads of the king’s sons.”"
2 Kings,10,10,"He said, “Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.”"
2 Kings,10,11,"In the morning, he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, “You are righteous. Behold, I conspired against my master and killed him, but who killed all these?"
2 Kings,10,12,"Know now that nothing will fall to the earth of Yahweh’s word, which Yahweh spoke concerning Ahab’s house. For Yahweh has done that which he spoke by his servant Elijah.”"
2 Kings,10,13,"So Jehu struck all that remained of Ahab’s house in Jezreel, with all his great men, his familiar friends, and his priests, until he left him no one remaining."
2 Kings,10,14,"He arose and departed, and went to Samaria. As he was at the shearing house of the shepherds on the way,"
2 Kings,10,15,"Jehu met with the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, “Who are you?”"
2 Kings,10,16,"They answered, “We are the brothers of Ahaziah. We are going down to greet the children of the king and the children of the queen.”"
2 Kings,10,17,"He said, “Take them alive!”"
2 Kings,10,18,"They took them alive, and killed them at the pit of the shearing house, even forty-two men. He didn’t leave any of them."
2 Kings,10,19,"When he had departed from there, he met Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him. He greeted him, and said to him, “Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart?”"
2 Kings,10,20,"Jehonadab answered, “It is.”"
2 Kings,10,21,"“If it is, give me your hand.” He gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot."
2 Kings,10,22,"He said, “Come with me, and see my zeal for Yahweh.” So they made him ride in his chariot."
2 Kings,10,23,"When he came to Samaria, he struck all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, until he had destroyed him, according to Yahweh’s word, which he spoke to Elijah."
2 Kings,10,24,"Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, “Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu will serve him much."
2 Kings,10,25,"Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all of his worshipers, and all of his priests. Let no one be absent; for I have a great sacrifice to Baal. Whoever is absent, he shall not live.” But Jehu did deceptively, intending to destroy the worshipers of Baal."
2 Kings,10,26,"Jehu said, “Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal!”"
2 Kings,10,27,So they proclaimed it.
2 Kings,10,28,"Jehu sent through all Israel; and all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that didn’t come. They came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to another."
2 Kings,10,29,"He said to him who kept the wardrobe, “Bring out robes for all the worshipers of Baal!”"
2 Kings,10,30,So he brought robes out to them.
2 Kings,10,31,"Jehu went with Jehonadab the son of Rechab into the house of Baal. Then he said to the worshipers of Baal, “Search, and see that none of the servants of Yahweh are here with you, but only the worshipers of Baal.”"
2 Kings,10,32,"So they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had appointed for himself eighty men outside, and said, “If any of the men whom I bring into your hands escape, he who lets him go, his life shall be for the life of him.”"
2 Kings,10,33,"As soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, “Go in and kill them! Let no one escape.” So they struck them with the edge of the sword. The guard and the captains threw the bodies out, and went to the inner shrine of the house of Baal."
2 Kings,10,34,"They brought out the pillars that were in the house of Baal, and burned them."
2 Kings,10,35,"They broke down the pillar of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a latrine, to this day."
2 Kings,10,36,Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.
2 Kings,10,37,"However, Jehu didn’t depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin, the golden calves that were in Bethel and that were in Dan."
2 Kings,10,38,"Yahweh said to Jehu, “Because you have done well in executing that which is right in my eyes, and have done to Ahab’s house according to all that was in my heart, your descendants shall sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation.”"
2 Kings,10,39,"But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of Yahweh, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He didn’t depart from the sins of Jeroboam, with which he made Israel to sin."
2 Kings,10,40,In those days Yahweh began to cut away parts of Israel; and Hazael struck them in all the borders of Israel;
2 Kings,10,41,"from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan."
2 Kings,10,42,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
2 Kings,10,43,Jehu slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria. Jehoahaz his son reigned in his place.
2 Kings,10,44,The time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.
2 Kings,10,45,
2 Kings,11,1,"Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal offspring."
2 Kings,11,2,"But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king’s sons who were slain, even him and his nurse, and put them in the bedroom; and they hid him from Athaliah, so that he was not slain."
2 Kings,11,3,He was with her hidden in Yahweh’s house six years while Athaliah reigned over the land.
2 Kings,11,4,"In the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the captains over hundreds of the Carites and of the guard, and brought them to him into Yahweh’s house; and he made a covenant with them, and made a covenant with them in Yahweh’s house, and showed them the king’s son."
2 Kings,11,5,"He commanded them, saying, “This is what you must do: a third of you, who come in on the Sabbath, shall be keepers of the watch of the king’s house;"
2 Kings,11,6,"a third of you shall be at the gate Sur; and a third of you at the gate behind the guard. So you shall keep the watch of the house, and be a barrier."
2 Kings,11,7,"The two companies of you, even all who go out on the Sabbath, shall keep the watch of Yahweh’s house around the king."
2 Kings,11,8,"You shall surround the king, every man with his weapons in his hand; and he who comes within the ranks, let him be slain. Be with the king when he goes out, and when he comes in.”"
2 Kings,11,9,"The captains over hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded; and they each took his men, those who were to come in on the Sabbath, with those who were to go out on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest."
2 Kings,11,10,"The priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spears and shields that had been king David’s, which were in Yahweh’s house."
2 Kings,11,11,"The guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, around the king."
2 Kings,11,12,"Then he brought out the king’s son, and put the crown on him, and gave him the covenant; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, “Long live the king!”"
2 Kings,11,13,"When Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into Yahweh’s house:"
2 Kings,11,14,"and she looked, and behold, the king stood by the pillar, as the tradition was, with the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her clothes, and cried, “Treason! Treason!”"
2 Kings,11,15,"Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them, “Bring her out between the ranks. Kill anyone who follows her with the sword.” For the priest said, “Don’t let her be slain in Yahweh’s house.”"
2 Kings,11,16,"So they made way for her; and she went by the way of the horses’ entry to the king’s house, and she was slain there."
2 Kings,11,17,"Jehoiada made a covenant between Yahweh and the king and the people, that they should be Yahweh’s people; also between the king and the people."
2 Kings,11,18,"All the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and broke it down; his altars and his images broke they in pieces thoroughly, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. The priest appointed officers over Yahweh’s house."
2 Kings,11,19,"He took the captains over hundreds, and the Carites, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from Yahweh’s house, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king’s house. He sat on the throne of the kings."
2 Kings,11,20,"So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. They had slain Athaliah with the sword at the king’s house."
2 Kings,11,21,Jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign.
2 Kings,11,22,
2 Kings,12,1,"Jehoash began to reign in the seventh year of Jehu, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zibiah of Beersheba."
2 Kings,12,2,Jehoash did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes all his days in which Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
2 Kings,12,3,However the high places were not taken away. The people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places.
2 Kings,12,4,"Jehoash said to the priests, “All the money of the holy things that is brought into Yahweh’s house, in current money, the money of the people for whom each man is evaluated, and all the money that it comes into any man’s heart to bring into Yahweh’s house,"
2 Kings,12,5,"let the priests take it to them, each man from his donor; and they shall repair the damage to the house, wherever any damage is found.”"
2 Kings,12,6,"But it was so, that in the twenty-third year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the damage to the house."
2 Kings,12,7,"Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and for the other priests, and said to them, “Why don’t you repair the damage to the house? Now therefore take no more money from your treasurers, but deliver it for repair of the damage to the house.”"
2 Kings,12,8,"The priests consented that they should take no more money from the people, and not repair the damage to the house."
2 Kings,12,9,"But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in its lid, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into Yahweh’s house; and the priests who kept the threshold put all the money that was brought into Yahweh’s house into it."
2 Kings,12,10,"When they saw that there was much money in the chest, the king’s scribe and the high priest came up, and they put it in bags and counted the money that was found in Yahweh’s house."
2 Kings,12,11,"They gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of those who did the work, who had the oversight of Yahweh’s house; and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders, who worked on Yahweh’s house,"
2 Kings,12,12,"and to the masons and the stone cutters, and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the damage to Yahweh’s house, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it."
2 Kings,12,13,"But there were not made for Yahweh’s house cups of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into Yahweh’s house;"
2 Kings,12,14,"for they gave that to those who did the work, and repaired Yahweh’s house with it."
2 Kings,12,15,Moreover they didn’t demand an accounting from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to give to those who did the work; for they dealt faithfully.
2 Kings,12,16,"The money for the trespass offerings, and the money for the sin offerings was not brought into Yahweh’s house. It was the priests’."
2 Kings,12,17,"Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it; and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem."
2 Kings,12,18,"Jehoash king of Judah took all the holy things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own holy things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of Yahweh’s house, and of the king’s house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria; and he went away from Jerusalem."
2 Kings,12,19,"Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,12,20,"His servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and struck Joash at the house of Millo, on the way that goes down to Silla."
2 Kings,12,21,"For Jozacar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, struck him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in David’s city; and Amaziah his son reigned in his place."
2 Kings,12,22,
2 Kings,13,1,"In the twenty-third year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria for seventeen years."
2 Kings,13,2,"He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin. He didn’t depart from it."
2 Kings,13,3,"Yahweh’s anger burned against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, continually."
2 Kings,13,4,"Jehoahaz begged Yahweh, and Yahweh listened to him; for he saw the oppression of Israel, how the king of Syria oppressed them."
2 Kings,13,5,"(Yahweh gave Israel a savior, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians; and the children of Israel lived in their tents as before."
2 Kings,13,6,"Nevertheless they didn’t depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, with which he made Israel to sin, but walked in them; and the Asherah also remained in Samaria.)"
2 Kings,13,7,"For he didn’t leave to Jehoahaz of the people any more than fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria destroyed them, and made them like the dust in threshing."
2 Kings,13,8,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
2 Kings,13,9,Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria; and Joash his son reigned in his place.
2 Kings,13,10,"In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz began to reign over Israel in Samaria for sixteen years."
2 Kings,13,11,"He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight. He didn’t depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin; but he walked in them."
2 Kings,13,12,"Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
2 Kings,13,13,Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat on his throne. Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
2 Kings,13,14,"Now Elisha became sick with the illness of which he died; and Joash the king of Israel came down to him, and wept over him, and said, “My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!”"
2 Kings,13,15,"Elisha said to him, “Take bow and arrows”; and he took bow and arrows for himself."
2 Kings,13,16,"He said to the king of Israel, “Put your hand on the bow”; and he put his hand on it. Elisha laid his hands on the king’s hands."
2 Kings,13,17,"He said, “Open the window eastward”; and he opened it. Then Elisha said, “Shoot!” and he shot. He said, “Yahweh’s arrow of victory, even the arrow of victory over Syria; for you will strike the Syrians in Aphek, until you have consumed them.”"
2 Kings,13,18,"He said, “Take the arrows”; and he took them. He said to the king of Israel, “Strike the ground”; and he struck three times, and stopped."
2 Kings,13,19,"The man of God was angry with him, and said, “You should have struck five or six times. Then you would have struck Syria until you had consumed it; whereas now you will strike Syria just three times.”"
2 Kings,13,20,"Elisha died, and they buried him."
2 Kings,13,21,Now the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.
2 Kings,13,22,"As they were burying a man, behold, they saw a band of raiders; and they threw the man into Elisha’s tomb. As soon as the man touched Elisha’s bones, he revived, and stood up on his feet."
2 Kings,13,23,Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
2 Kings,13,24,"But Yahweh was gracious to them, and had compassion on them, and had respect for them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, and he didn’t cast them from his presence as yet."
2 Kings,13,25,Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his place.
2 Kings,13,26,"Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Joash struck him three times, and recovered the cities of Israel."
2 Kings,13,27,
2 Kings,14,1,In the second year of Joash son of Joahaz king of Israel Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah began to reign.

2 Kings,14,3,"He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, yet not like David his father. He did according to all that Joash his father had done."
2 Kings,14,4,However the high places were not taken away. The people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places.
2 Kings,14,5,"As soon as the kingdom was established in his hand, he killed his servants who had slain the king his father,"
2 Kings,14,6,"but the children of the murderers he didn’t put to death; according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, as Yahweh commanded, saying, “The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin.”"
2 Kings,14,7,"He killed ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt, and took Sela by war, and called its name Joktheel, to this day."
2 Kings,14,8,"Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come, let us look one another in the face.”"
2 Kings,14,9,"Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, “The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son as wife. Then a wild animal that was in Lebanon passed by, and trampled down the thistle."
2 Kings,14,10,"You have indeed struck Edom, and your heart has lifted you up. Enjoy the glory of it, and stay at home; for why should you meddle to your harm, that you fall, even you, and Judah with you?’”"
2 Kings,14,11,"But Amaziah would not listen. So Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah."
2 Kings,14,12,Judah was defeated by Israel; and each man fled to his tent.
2 Kings,14,13,"Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth Shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits."
2 Kings,14,14,"He took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in Yahweh’s house and in the treasures of the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria."

2 Kings,14,26,"For Yahweh saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter; for all, slave and free, and there was no helper for Israel."
2 Kings,14,27,Yahweh didn’t say that he would blot out the name of Israel from under the sky; but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.
2 Kings,14,28,"Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he fought, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, which had belonged to Judah, for Israel, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"

2 Kings,17,11,"and there they burned incense in all the high places, as the nations whom Yahweh carried away before them did; and they did wicked things to provoke Yahweh to anger;"
2 Kings,17,12,"and they served idols, of which Yahweh had said to them, “You shall not do this thing.”"
2 Kings,17,13,"Yet Yahweh testified to Israel, and to Judah, by every prophet, and every seer, saying, “Turn from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.”"
2 Kings,17,14,"Notwithstanding, they would not listen, but hardened their neck, like the neck of their fathers, who didn’t believe in Yahweh their God."
2 Kings,17,15,"They rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified to them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and followed the nations that were around them, concerning whom Yahweh had commanded them that they should not do like them."
2 Kings,17,16,"They abandoned all the commandments of Yahweh their God, and made molten images for themselves, even two calves, and made an Asherah, and worshiped all the army of the sky, and served Baal."
2 Kings,17,17,"They caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, to provoke him to anger."
2 Kings,17,18,"Therefore Yahweh was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight. There was none left but the tribe of Judah only."
2 Kings,17,19,"Also Judah didn’t keep the commandments of Yahweh their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made."
2 Kings,17,20,"Yahweh rejected all the offspring of Israel, afflicted them, and delivered them into the hands of raiders, until he had cast them out of his sight."
2 Kings,17,21,"For he tore Israel from David’s house; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king; and Jeroboam drove Israel from following Yahweh, and made them sin a great sin."
2 Kings,17,22,The children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they didn’t depart from them
2 Kings,17,23,"until Yahweh removed Israel out of his sight, as he said by all his servants the prophets. So Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria to this day."
2 Kings,17,24,"The king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, from Cuthah, from Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel; and they possessed Samaria, and lived in its cities."
2 Kings,17,25,"So it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they didn’t fear Yahweh. Therefore Yahweh sent lions among them, which killed some of them."
2 Kings,17,26,"Therefore they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, “The nations which you have carried away and placed in the cities of Samaria don’t know the law of the god of the land. Therefore he has sent lions among them, and behold, they kill them, because they don’t know the law of the god of the land.”"
2 Kings,17,27,"Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, “Carry there one of the priests whom you brought from there; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the law of the god of the land.”"
2 Kings,17,28,"So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and lived in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear Yahweh."
2 Kings,17,29,"However every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities in which they lived."
2 Kings,17,30,"The men of Babylon made Succoth Benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,"
2 Kings,17,31,"and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim."
2 Kings,17,32,"So they feared Yahweh, and also made from among themselves priests of the high places for themselves, who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places."
2 Kings,17,33,"They feared Yahweh, and also served their own gods, after the ways of the nations from among whom they had been carried away."
2 Kings,17,34,"To this day they do what they did before. They don’t fear Yahweh, and they do not follow the statutes, or the ordinances, or the law, or the commandment which Yahweh commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;"
2 Kings,17,35,"with whom Yahweh had made a covenant, and commanded them, saying, “You shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them;"
2 Kings,17,36,"but you shall fear Yahweh, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm, and you shall bow yourselves to him, and you shall sacrifice to him."
2 Kings,17,37,"The statutes and the ordinances, and the law and the commandment, which he wrote for you, you shall observe to do forever more. You shall not fear other gods."
2 Kings,17,38,You shall not forget the covenant that I have made with you. You shall not fear other gods.
2 Kings,17,39,"But you shall fear Yahweh your God, and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.”"
2 Kings,17,40,"However they did not listen, but they did what they did before."
2 Kings,17,41,"So these nations feared Yahweh, and also served their engraved images. Their children likewise, and their children’s children, as their fathers did, so they do to this day."
2 Kings,17,42,
2 Kings,18,1,"Now in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign."
2 Kings,18,2,"He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah."
2 Kings,18,3,"He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, according to all that David his father had done."
2 Kings,18,4,"He removed the high places, and broke the pillars, and cut down the Asherah. He also broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made, because in those days the children of Israel burned incense to it; and he called it Nehushtan."
2 Kings,18,5,"He trusted in Yahweh, the God of Israel; so that after him was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, nor among them that were before him."
2 Kings,18,6,"For he joined with Yahweh. He didn’t depart from following him, but kept his commandments, which Yahweh commanded Moses."
2 Kings,18,7,"Yahweh was with him. Wherever he went, he prospered. He rebelled against the king of Assyria, and didn’t serve him."
2 Kings,18,8,"He struck the Philistines to Gaza and its borders, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city."
2 Kings,18,9,"In the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it."
2 Kings,18,10,"At the end of three years they took it. In the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken."
2 Kings,18,11,"The king of Assyria carried Israel away to Assyria, and put them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,"
2 Kings,18,12,"because they didn’t obey Yahweh their God’s voice, but transgressed his covenant, even all that Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded, and would not hear it or do it."
2 Kings,18,13,"Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them."
2 Kings,18,14,"Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, “I have offended you. Return from me. That which you put on me, I will bear.” The king of Assyria appointed to Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold."
2 Kings,18,15,"Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in Yahweh’s house, and in the treasures of the king’s house."
2 Kings,18,16,"At that time, Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of Yahweh’s temple, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria."
2 Kings,18,17,"The king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army to Jerusalem. They went up and came to Jerusalem. When they had come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller’s field."
2 Kings,18,18,"When they had called to the king, Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder came out to them."
2 Kings,18,19,"Rabshakeh said to them, “Say now to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, “What confidence is this in which you trust?"
2 Kings,18,20,"You say (but they are but vain words), ‘There is counsel and strength for war.’ Now on whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me?"
2 Kings,18,21,"Now, behold, you trust in the staff of this bruised reed, even in Egypt. If a man leans on it, it will go into his hand, and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust on him."
2 Kings,18,22,"But if you tell me, ‘We trust in Yahweh our God;’ isn’t that he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, ‘You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?’"
2 Kings,18,23,"Now therefore, please give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them."
2 Kings,18,24,"How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?"
2 Kings,18,25,"Have I now come up without Yahweh against this place to destroy it? Yahweh said to me, ‘Go up against this land, and destroy it.’”’”"
2 Kings,18,26,"Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, Shebnah, and Joah, said to Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in the Syrian language, for we understand it. Don’t speak with us in the Jews’ language, in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.”"
2 Kings,18,27,"But Rabshakeh said to them, “Has my master sent me to your master and to you, to speak these words? Hasn’t he sent me to the men who sit on the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own urine with you?”"
2 Kings,18,28,"Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and spoke, saying, “Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria."
2 Kings,18,29,"Thus says the king, ‘Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand."
2 Kings,18,30,"Don’t let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh, saying, “Yahweh will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.”"
2 Kings,18,31,"Don’t listen to Hezekiah.’ For thus says the king of Assyria, ‘Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and everyone of you eat from his own vine, and everyone from his own fig tree, and everyone drink water from his own cistern;"
2 Kings,18,32,"until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and of honey, that you may live, and not die. Don’t listen to Hezekiah, when he persuades you, saying, “Yahweh will deliver us.”"
2 Kings,18,33,Has any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
2 Kings,18,34,"Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?"
2 Kings,18,35,"Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Yahweh should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?’”"
2 Kings,18,36,"But the people stayed quiet, and answered him not a word; for the king’s commandment was, “Don’t answer him.”"
2 Kings,18,37,"Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, came with Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him Rabshakeh’s words."
2 Kings,18,38,
2 Kings,19,1,"When king Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into Yahweh’s house."
2 Kings,19,2,"He sent Eliakim, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz."
2 Kings,19,3,"They said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah, ‘Today is a day of trouble, of rebuke, and of rejection; for the children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to deliver them."
2 Kings,19,4,"It may be Yahweh your God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Yahweh your God has heard. Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.’”"
2 Kings,19,5,So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
2 Kings,19,6,"Isaiah said to them, “Tell your master this: ‘Yahweh says, “Don’t be afraid of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me."
2 Kings,19,7,"Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he will hear news, and will return to his own land. I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.”’”"
2 Kings,19,8,So Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.
2 Kings,19,9,"When he heard it said of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, “Behold, he has come out to fight against you, he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,"
2 Kings,19,10,"‘Tell Hezekiah king of Judah this: “Don’t let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria."
2 Kings,19,11,"Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly. Will you be delivered?"
2 Kings,19,12,"Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the children of Eden who were in Telassar?"
2 Kings,19,13,"Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?”’”"
2 Kings,19,14,"Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it. Then Hezekiah went up to Yahweh’s house, and spread it before Yahweh."
2 Kings,19,15,"Hezekiah prayed before Yahweh, and said, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, who sit above the cherubim, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth."
2 Kings,19,16,"Incline your ear, Yahweh, and hear. Open your eyes, Yahweh, and see. Hear the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to defy the living God."
2 Kings,19,17,"Truly, Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands,"
2 Kings,19,18,"and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone. Therefore they have destroyed them."
2 Kings,19,19,"Now therefore, Yahweh our God, save us, I beg you, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, Yahweh, are God alone.”"
2 Kings,19,20,"Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says ‘You have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, and I have heard you."
2 Kings,19,21,This is the word that Yahweh has spoken concerning him: ‘The virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and ridiculed you. The daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.
2 Kings,19,22,Whom have you defied and blasphemed? Against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel!
2 Kings,19,23,"By your messengers, you have defied the Lord, and have said, “With the multitude of my chariots, I have come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon, and I will cut down its tall cedars and its choice cypress trees; and I will enter into his farthest lodging place, the forest of his fruitful field."
2 Kings,19,24,"I have dug and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt.”"
2 Kings,19,25,"Haven’t you heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? Now I have brought it to pass, that it should be yours to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps."
2 Kings,19,26,"Therefore their inhabitants had little power. They were dismayed and confounded. They were like the grass of the field, and like the green herb, like the grass on the housetops, and like grain blasted before it has grown up."
2 Kings,19,27,"But I know your sitting down, your going out, your coming in, and your raging against me."
2 Kings,19,28,"Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance has come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in your nose, and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.’"
2 Kings,19,29,"“This will be the sign to you: This year, you will eat that which grows of itself, and in the second year that which springs of the same; and in the third year sow, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat its fruit."
2 Kings,19,30,"The remnant that has escaped of the house of Judah will again take root downward, and bear fruit upward."
2 Kings,19,31,"For out of Jerusalem a remnant will go out, and out of Mount Zion those who shall escape. Yahweh’s zeal will perform this."
2 Kings,19,32,"“Therefore Yahweh says concerning the king of Assyria, ‘He will not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there. He will not come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it."
2 Kings,19,33,"By the way that he came, by the same he will return, and he will not come to this city,’ says Yahweh."
2 Kings,19,34,"‘For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.’”"
2 Kings,19,35,"That night, Yahweh’s angel went out, and struck one hundred eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians. When men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies."
2 Kings,19,36,"So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and lived at Nineveh."
2 Kings,19,37,"As he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. Esar Haddon his son reigned in his place."
2 Kings,19,38,
2 Kings,20,1,"In those days Hezekiah was sick and dying. Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, “Yahweh says, ‘Set your house in order; for you will die, and not live.’”"
2 Kings,20,2,"Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed to Yahweh, saying,"
2 Kings,20,3,"“Remember now, Yahweh, I beg you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly."
2 Kings,20,4,"Before Isaiah had gone out into the middle part of the city, Yahweh’s word came to him, saying,"
2 Kings,20,5,"“Turn back, and tell Hezekiah the prince of my people, ‘Yahweh, the God of David your father, says, “I have heard your prayer. I have seen your tears. Behold, I will heal you. On the third day, you will go up to Yahweh’s house."
2 Kings,20,6,"I will add to your days fifteen years. I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city for my own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.”’”"
2 Kings,20,7,"Isaiah said, “Take a cake of figs.”"
2 Kings,20,8,"They took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered."
2 Kings,20,9,"Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “What will be the sign that Yahweh will heal me, and that I will go up to Yahweh’s house the third day?”"
2 Kings,20,10,"Isaiah said, “This will be the sign to you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will do the thing that he has spoken: should the shadow go forward ten steps, or go back ten steps?”"
2 Kings,20,11,"Hezekiah answered, “It is a light thing for the shadow to go forward ten steps. No, but let the shadow return backward ten steps.”"
2 Kings,20,12,"Isaiah the prophet cried to Yahweh; and he brought the shadow ten steps backward, by which it had gone down on the sundial of Ahaz."
2 Kings,20,13,"At that time Berodach Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick."
2 Kings,20,14,"Hezekiah listened to them, and showed them all the storehouse of his precious things, the silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil, and the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures. There was nothing in his house, or in all his dominion, that Hezekiah didn’t show them."
2 Kings,20,15,"Then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah, and said to him, “What did these men say? From where did they come to you?”"
2 Kings,20,16,"Hezekiah said, “They have come from a far country, even from Babylon.”"
2 Kings,20,17,"He said, “What have they seen in your house?”"
2 Kings,20,18,"Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house. There is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.”"
2 Kings,20,19,"Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear Yahweh’s word."
2 Kings,20,20,"‘Behold, the days come that all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have laid up in store to this day, will be carried to Babylon. Nothing will be left,’ says Yahweh."
2 Kings,20,21,"‘They will take away some of your sons who will issue from you, whom you will father; and they will be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.’”"
2 Kings,20,22,"Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “Yahweh’s word which you have spoken is good.” He said moreover, “Isn’t it so, if peace and truth will be in my days?”"
2 Kings,20,23,"Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made the pool, and the conduit, and brought water into the city, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,20,24,"Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and Manasseh his son reigned in his place."
2 Kings,20,25,
2 Kings,21,1,"Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hephzibah."
2 Kings,21,2,"He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, after the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel."
2 Kings,21,3,"For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he raised up altars for Baal, and made an Asherah, as Ahab king of Israel did, and worshiped all the army of the sky, and served them."
2 Kings,21,4,"He built altars in Yahweh’s house, of which Yahweh said, “I will put my name in Jerusalem.”"
2 Kings,21,5,He built altars for all the army of the sky in the two courts of Yahweh’s house.
2 Kings,21,6,"He made his son to pass through the fire, practiced sorcery, used enchantments, and dealt with those who had familiar spirits, and with wizards. He did much evil in Yahweh’s sight, to provoke him to anger."
2 Kings,21,7,"He set the engraved image of Asherah that he had made in the house of which Yahweh said to David and to Solomon his son, “In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name forever;"
2 Kings,21,8,"I will not cause the feet of Israel to wander any more out of the land which I gave their fathers, if only they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.”"
2 Kings,21,9,"But they didn’t listen, and Manasseh seduced them to do that which is evil more than the nations did whom Yahweh destroyed before the children of Israel."
2 Kings,21,10,"Yahweh spoke by his servants the prophets, saying,"
2 Kings,21,11,"“Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations, and has done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, who were before him, and has also made Judah to sin with his idols;"
2 Kings,21,12,"therefore Yahweh the God of Israel says, ‘Behold, I bring such evil on Jerusalem and Judah that whoever hears of it, both his ears will tingle."
2 Kings,21,13,"I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of Ahab’s house; and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down."
2 Kings,21,14,"I will cast off the remnant of my inheritance, and deliver them into the hands of their enemies. They will become a prey and a plunder to all their enemies,"
2 Kings,21,15,"because they have done that which is evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came out of Egypt, even to this day.’”"
2 Kings,21,16,"Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; besides his sin with which he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight."
2 Kings,21,17,"Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,21,18,"Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza; and Amon his son reigned in his place."
2 Kings,21,19,Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
2 Kings,21,20,"He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, as Manasseh his father did."
2 Kings,21,21,"He walked in all the ways that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshiped them;"
2 Kings,21,22,"and he abandoned Yahweh, the God of his fathers, and didn’t walk in the way of Yahweh."
2 Kings,21,23,"The servants of Amon conspired against him, and put the king to death in his own house."
2 Kings,21,24,But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place.
2 Kings,21,25,"Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,21,26,"He was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza, and Josiah his son reigned in his place."
2 Kings,21,27,
2 Kings,22,1,"Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath."
2 Kings,22,2,"He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, and walked in all the way of David his father, and didn’t turn away to the right hand or to the left."
2 Kings,22,3,"In the eighteenth year of king Josiah, the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to Yahweh’s house, saying,"
2 Kings,22,4,"“Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may count the money which is brought into Yahweh’s house, which the keepers of the threshold have gathered of the people."
2 Kings,22,5,"Let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of Yahweh’s house; and let them give it to the workmen who are in Yahweh’s house, to repair the damage to the house,"
2 Kings,22,6,"to the carpenters, and to the builders, and to the masons, and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the house."
2 Kings,22,7,However there was no accounting made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand; for they dealt faithfully.”
2 Kings,22,8,"Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the book of the law in Yahweh’s house.” Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan, and he read it."
2 Kings,22,9,"Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, “Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hands of the workmen who have the oversight of Yahweh’s house.”"
2 Kings,22,10,"Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, “Hilkiah the priest has delivered a book to me.” Then Shaphan read it before the king."
2 Kings,22,11,"When the king had heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes."
2 Kings,22,12,"The king commanded Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Achbor the son of Micaiah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying,"
2 Kings,22,13,"“Go inquire of Yahweh for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found; for great is Yahweh’s wrath that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not listened to the words of this book, to do according to all that which is written concerning us.”"
2 Kings,22,14,"So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter); and they talked with her."
2 Kings,22,15,"She said to them, “Yahweh the God of Israel says, ‘Tell the man who sent you to me,"
2 Kings,22,16,"“Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will bring evil on this place, and on its inhabitants, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read."
2 Kings,22,17,"Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and it will not be quenched.’”"
2 Kings,22,18,"But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Yahweh, tell him, “Yahweh the God of Israel says, ‘Concerning the words which you have heard,"
2 Kings,22,19,"because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before Yahweh, when you heard what I spoke against this place, and against its inhabitants, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and have torn your clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard you,’ says Yahweh."
2 Kings,22,20,"‘Therefore behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace. Your eyes will not see all the evil which I will bring on this place.’”’” So they brought this message back to the king."
2 Kings,22,21,
2 Kings,23,1,"The king sent, and they gathered to him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem."
2 Kings,23,2,"The king went up to Yahweh’s house, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, with the priests, the prophets, and all the people, both small and great; and he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in Yahweh’s house."
2 Kings,23,3,"The king stood by the pillar, and made a covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh, and to keep his commandments, his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and all his soul, to confirm the words of this covenant that were written in this book; and all the people agreed to the covenant."
2 Kings,23,4,"The king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the threshold, to bring out of Yahweh’s temple all the vessels that were made for Baal, for the Asherah, and for all the army of the sky, and he burned them outside of Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and carried their ashes to Bethel."
2 Kings,23,5,"He got rid of the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places around Jerusalem; those also who burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the army of the sky."
2 Kings,23,6,"He brought out the Asherah from Yahweh’s house, outside of Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and beat it to dust, and cast its dust on the graves of the common people."
2 Kings,23,7,"He broke down the houses of the male shrine prostitutes that were in Yahweh’s house, where the women wove hangings for the Asherah."
2 Kings,23,8,"He brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba; and he broke down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man’s left hand at the gate of the city."
2 Kings,23,9,"Nevertheless the priests of the high places didn’t come up to Yahweh’s altar in Jerusalem, but they ate unleavened bread among their brothers."
2 Kings,23,10,"He defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech."
2 Kings,23,11,"He took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of Yahweh’s house, by the room of Nathan Melech the officer, who was in the court; and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire."
2 Kings,23,12,"The king broke down the altars that were on the roof of the upper room of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of Yahweh’s house, and beat them down from there, and cast their dust into the brook Kidron."
2 Kings,23,13,"The king defiled the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mountain of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon."
2 Kings,23,14,"He broke in pieces the pillars, cut down the Asherah poles, and filled their places with men’s bones."
2 Kings,23,15,"Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he broke down; and he burned the high place and beat it to dust, and burned the Asherah."
2 Kings,23,16,"As Josiah turned himself, he spied the tombs that were there in the mountain; and he sent, and took the bones out of the tombs, and burned them on the altar, and defiled it, according to Yahweh’s word which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these things."
2 Kings,23,17,"Then he said, “What monument is that which I see?”"
2 Kings,23,18,"The men of the city told him, “It is the tomb of the man of God, who came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that you have done against the altar of Bethel.”"
2 Kings,23,19,"He said, “Let him be! Let no one move his bones.” So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet who came out of Samaria."
2 Kings,23,20,"All the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke Yahweh to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel."
2 Kings,23,21,"He killed all the priests of the high places that were there, on the altars, and burned men’s bones on them; and he returned to Jerusalem."
2 Kings,23,22,"The king commanded all the people, saying, “Keep the Passover to Yahweh your God, as it is written in this book of the covenant.”"
2 Kings,23,23,"Surely there was not kept such a Passover from the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;"
2 Kings,23,24,"but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, this Passover was kept to Yahweh in Jerusalem."
2 Kings,23,25,"Moreover Josiah removed those who had familiar spirits, the wizards, and the teraphim, and the idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, that he might confirm the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in Yahweh’s house."
2 Kings,23,26,"There was no king like him before him, who turned to Yahweh with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; and there was none like him who arose after him."
2 Kings,23,27,"Notwithstanding, Yahweh didn’t turn from the fierceness of his great wrath, with which his anger burned against Judah, because of all the provocation with which Manasseh had provoked him."
2 Kings,23,28,"Yahweh said, “I will also remove Judah out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and I will cast off this city which I have chosen, even Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, ‘My name shall be there.’”"
2 Kings,23,29,"Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,23,30,"In his days Pharaoh Necoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates; and king Josiah went against him; and Pharaoh Necoh killed him at Megiddo, when he had seen him."
2 Kings,23,31,"His servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb. The people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father’s place."
2 Kings,23,32,Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
2 Kings,23,33,"He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, according to all that his fathers had done."
2 Kings,23,34,"Pharaoh Necoh put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of one hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold."
2 Kings,23,35,"Pharaoh Necoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the place of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim; but he took Jehoahaz away, and he came to Egypt and died there."
2 Kings,23,36,"Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh. He exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, from everyone according to his assessment, to give it to Pharaoh Necoh."
2 Kings,23,37,"Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah."
2 Kings,23,38,"He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, according to all that his fathers had done."
2 Kings,23,39,
2 Kings,24,1,"In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years. Then he turned and rebelled against him."
2 Kings,24,2,"Yahweh sent against him bands of the Chaldeans, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to Yahweh’s word, which he spoke by his servants the prophets."
2 Kings,24,3,"Surely at the commandment of Yahweh this came on Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did,"
2 Kings,24,4,"and also for the innocent blood that he shed; for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and Yahweh would not pardon."
2 Kings,24,5,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,24,6,"So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers, and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place."
2 Kings,24,7,"The king of Egypt didn’t come out of his land any more; for the king of Babylon had taken, from the brook of Egypt to the river Euphrates, all that belonged to the king of Egypt."
2 Kings,24,8,"Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mother’s name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem."
2 Kings,24,9,"He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, according to all that his father had done."
2 Kings,24,10,"At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged."
2 Kings,24,11,"Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to the city while his servants were besieging it,"
2 Kings,24,12,"and Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers; and the king of Babylon captured him in the eighth year of his reign."
2 Kings,24,13,"He carried out from there all the treasures of Yahweh’s house, and the treasures of the king’s house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold, which Solomon king of Israel had made in Yahweh’s temple, as Yahweh had said."
2 Kings,24,14,"He carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths. No one remained, except the poorest people of the land."
2 Kings,24,15,"He carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, with the king’s mother, the king’s wives, his officers, and the chief men of the land. He carried them into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon."
2 Kings,24,16,"All the men of might, even seven thousand, and the craftsmen and the smiths one thousand, all of them strong and fit for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon."
2 Kings,24,17,"The king of Babylon made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin’s father’s brother, king in his place, and changed his name to Zedekiah."
2 Kings,24,18,"Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah."
2 Kings,24,19,"He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, according to all that Jehoiakim had done."
2 Kings,24,20,"For through the anger of Yahweh, this happened in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence."
2 Kings,24,21,Then Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
2 Kings,24,22,
2 Kings,25,1,"In the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it around it."
2 Kings,25,2,So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
2 Kings,25,3,"On the ninth day of the fourth month, the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land."
2 Kings,25,4,"Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden (now the Chaldeans were against the city around it); and the king went by the way of the Arabah."
2 Kings,25,5,"But the Chaldean army pursued the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him."
2 Kings,25,6,"Then they captured the king, and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they passed judgment on him."
2 Kings,25,7,"They killed Zedekiah’s sons before his eyes, then put out Zedekiah’s eyes, bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon."
2 Kings,25,8,"Now in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem."
2 Kings,25,9,"He burned Yahweh’s house, the king’s house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, he burned with fire."
2 Kings,25,10,"All the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls around Jerusalem."
2 Kings,25,11,"Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive the residue of the people who were left in the city, and those who fell away, who fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude."
2 Kings,25,12,But the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to work the vineyards and fields.
2 Kings,25,13,"The Chaldeans broke up the pillars of brass that were in Yahweh’s house and the bases and the bronze sea that were in Yahweh’s house, and carried the brass pieces to Babylon."
2 Kings,25,14,"They took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered."
2 Kings,25,15,"The captain of the guard took away the fire pans, the basins, that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver."
2 Kings,25,16,"The two pillars, the one sea, and the bases, which Solomon had made for Yahweh’s house, the brass of all these vessels was not weighed."
2 Kings,25,17,"The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a capital of brass was on it. The height of the capital was three cubits, with network and pomegranates on the capital around it, all of brass; and the second pillar with its network was like these."
2 Kings,25,18,"The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold;"
2 Kings,25,19,"and out of the city he took an officer who was set over the men of war; and five men of those who saw the king’s face, who were found in the city; and the scribe, the captain of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the city."
2 Kings,25,20,"Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah."
2 Kings,25,21,"The king of Babylon attacked them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land."
2 Kings,25,22,"As for the people who were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor."
2 Kings,25,23,"Now when all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men."
2 Kings,25,24,"Gedaliah swore to them and to their men, and said to them, “Don’t be afraid because of the servants of the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you.”"
2 Kings,25,25,"But in the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal offspring came, and ten men with him, and struck Gedaliah, so that he died, with the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah."
2 Kings,25,26,"All the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces, arose, and came to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans."
2 Kings,25,27,"In the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, Evilmerodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;"
2 Kings,25,28,"and he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon,"
2 Kings,25,29,and changed his prison garments. Jehoiachin ate bread before him continually all the days of his life;
2 Kings,25,30,"and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him from the king, every day a portion, all the days of his life."
2 Kings,25,31,
2 Kings,1,1,Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
2 Kings,1,2,"Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper room that was in Samaria, and was sick. So he sent messengers, and said to them, “Go, inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I will recover of this sickness.”"
2 Kings,1,3,"But Yahweh’s angel said to Elijah the Tishbite, “Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and tell them, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you go to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron?"
2 Kings,1,4,"Now therefore Yahweh says, “You will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you will surely die.”’” Then Elijah departed."
2 Kings,1,5,"The messengers returned to him, and he said to them, “Why is it that you have returned?”"
2 Kings,1,6,"They said to him, “A man came up to meet us, and said to us, ‘Go, return to the king who sent you, and tell him, “Yahweh says, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you send to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you will surely die.’”’”"
2 Kings,1,7,"He said to them, “What kind of man was he who came up to meet you, and told you these words?”"
2 Kings,1,8,"They answered him, “He was a hairy man, and wearing a leather belt around his waist.”"
2 Kings,1,9,"He said, “It’s Elijah the Tishbite.”"
2 Kings,1,10,"Then the king sent a captain of fifty with his fifty to him. He went up to him; and behold, he was sitting on the top of the hill. He said to him, “Man of God, the king has said, ‘Come down!’”"
2 Kings,1,11,"Elijah answered to the captain of fifty, “If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty!” Then fire came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty."
2 Kings,1,12,"Again he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. He answered him, “Man of God, the king has said, ‘Come down quickly!’”"
2 Kings,1,13,"Elijah answered them, “If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty!” Then God’s fire came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty."
2 Kings,1,14,"Again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. The third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and begged him, and said to him, “Man of God, please let my life, and the life of these fifty of your servants, be precious in your sight."
2 Kings,1,15,"Behold, fire came down from the sky, and consumed the last two captains of fifty with their fifties. But now let my life be precious in your sight.”"
2 Kings,1,16,"Yahweh’s angel said to Elijah, “Go down with him. Don’t be afraid of him.”"
2 Kings,1,17,"Then he arose, and went down with him to the king."
2 Kings,1,18,"He said to him, “Yahweh says, ‘Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? Therefore you will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you will surely die.’”"
2 Kings,1,19,"So he died according to Yahweh’s word which Elijah had spoken. Jehoram began to reign in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, because he had no son."
2 Kings,1,20,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
2 Kings,1,21,
2 Kings,2,1,"When Yahweh was about to take Elijah up by a whirlwind into heaven, Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal."
2 Kings,2,2,"Elijah said to Elisha, “Please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me as far as Bethel.”"
2 Kings,2,3,"Elisha said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” So they went down to Bethel."
2 Kings,2,4,"The sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from your head today?”"
2 Kings,2,5,"He said, “Yes, I know it. Hold your peace.”"
2 Kings,2,6,"Elijah said to him, “Elisha, please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me to Jericho.”"
2 Kings,2,7,"He said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” So they came to Jericho."
2 Kings,2,8,"The sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from your head today?”"
2 Kings,2,9,"He answered, “Yes, I know it. Hold your peace.”"
2 Kings,2,10,"Elijah said to him, “Please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me to the Jordan.”"
2 Kings,2,11,"He said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” Then they both went on."
2 Kings,2,12,"Fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood opposite them at a distance; and they both stood by the Jordan."
2 Kings,2,13,"Elijah took his mantle, and rolled it up, and struck the waters, and they were divided here and there, so that they both went over on dry ground."
2 Kings,2,14,"When they had gone over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask what I shall do for you, before I am taken from you.”"
2 Kings,2,15,"Elisha said, “Please let a double portion of your spirit be on me.”"
2 Kings,2,16,"He said, “You have asked a hard thing. If you see me when I am taken from you, it will be so for you; but if not, it will not be so.”"
2 Kings,2,17,"As they continued on and talked, behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated them, and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven."
2 Kings,2,18,"Elisha saw it, and he cried, “My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!”"
2 Kings,2,19,"He saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes, and tore them in two pieces."
2 Kings,2,20,"He also took up Elijah’s mantle that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan."
2 Kings,2,21,"He took Elijah’s mantle that fell from him, and struck the waters, and said, “Where is Yahweh, the God of Elijah?” When he also had struck the waters, they were divided apart, and Elisha went over."
2 Kings,2,22,"When the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho over against him saw him, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” They came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him."
2 Kings,2,23,"They said to him, “See now, there are with your servants fifty strong men. Please let them go and seek your master. Perhaps Yahweh’s Spirit has taken him up, and put him on some mountain, or into some valley.”"
2 Kings,2,24,"He said, “Don’t send them.”"
2 Kings,2,25,"When they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, “Send them.”"
2 Kings,2,26,"Therefore they sent fifty men; and they searched for three days, but didn’t find him."
2 Kings,2,27,"They came back to him, while he stayed at Jericho; and he said to them, “Didn’t I tell you, ‘Don’t go?’”"
2 Kings,2,28,"The men of the city said to Elisha, “Behold, please, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the land is barren.”"
2 Kings,2,29,"He said, “Bring me a new jar, and put salt in it.” Then they brought it to him."
2 Kings,2,30,"He went out to the spring of the waters, and threw salt into it, and said, “Yahweh says, ‘I have healed these waters. There shall not be from there any more death or barren wasteland.’”"
2 Kings,2,31,"So the waters were healed to this day, according to Elisha’s word which he spoke."
2 Kings,2,32,"He went up from there to Bethel. As he was going up by the way, some youths came out of the city and mocked him, and said to him, “Go up, you baldy! Go up, you baldy!”"
2 Kings,2,33,"He looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in Yahweh’s name. Then two female bears came out of the woods, and mauled forty-two of those youths."
2 Kings,2,34,"He went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria."
2 Kings,2,35,
2 Kings,3,1,"Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years."
2 Kings,3,2,"He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, but not like his father, and like his mother, for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made.Nevertheless he held to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin. He didn’t depart from them.Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder; and he supplied the king of Israel with the wool of one hundred thousand lambs, and of one hundred thousand rams."
2 Kings,3,3,"But when Ahab was dead, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel."
2 Kings,3,4,"King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel."
2 Kings,3,5,"He went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me against Moab to battle?”"
2 Kings,3,6,"He said, “I will go up. I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”"
2 Kings,3,7,"He said, “Which way shall we go up?”"
2 Kings,3,8,"He answered, “The way of the wilderness of Edom.”"
2 Kings,3,9,"So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom, and they marched for seven days along a circuitous route. There was no water for the army or for the animals that followed them."
2 Kings,3,10,"The king of Israel said, “Alas! For Yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.”"
2 Kings,3,11,"But Jehoshaphat said, “Isn’t there a prophet of Yahweh here, that we may inquire of Yahweh by him?”"
2 Kings,3,12,"One of the king of Israel’s servants answered, “Elisha the son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah, is here.”"
2 Kings,3,13,"Jehoshaphat said, “Yahweh’s word is with him.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him."
2 Kings,3,14,"Elisha said to the king of Israel, “What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets of your mother.”"
2 Kings,3,15,"The king of Israel said to him, “No, for Yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.”"
2 Kings,3,16,"Elisha said, “As Yahweh of Armies lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I respect the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward you, nor see you."
2 Kings,3,17,"But now bring me a musician.” When the musician played, Yahweh’s hand came on him."
2 Kings,3,18,"He said, “Yahweh says, ‘Make this valley full of trenches.’"
2 Kings,3,19,"For Yahweh says, ‘You will not see wind, neither will you see rain, yet that valley will be filled with water, and you will drink, both you and your livestock and your other animals."
2 Kings,3,20,This is an easy thing in Yahweh’s sight. He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.
2 Kings,3,21,"You shall strike every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all springs of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.’”"
2 Kings,3,22,"In the morning, about the time of offering the sacrifice, behold, water came by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water."
2 Kings,3,23,"Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all who were able to put on armor, young and old, and stood on the border."
2 Kings,3,24,"They rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water opposite them as red as blood."
2 Kings,3,25,"They said, “This is blood. The kings are surely destroyed, and they have struck each other. Now therefore, Moab, to the plunder!”"
2 Kings,3,26,"When they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land attacking the Moabites."
2 Kings,3,27,"They beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land each man cast his stone, and filled it. They also stopped all the springs of water, and felled all the good trees, until in Kir Hareseth all they left was its stones; however the men armed with slings went around it, and attacked it."
2 Kings,3,28,"When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew a sword, to break through to the king of Edom; but they could not."
2 Kings,3,29,"Then he took his oldest son who would have reigned in his place, and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. There was great wrath against Israel; and they departed from him, and returned to their own land."
2 Kings,3,30,
2 Kings,4,1,"Now a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, saying, “Your servant my husband is dead. You know that your servant feared Yahweh. Now the creditor has come to take for himself my two children to be slaves.”"
2 Kings,4,2,"Elisha said to her, “What should I do for you? Tell me: what do you have in the house?”"
2 Kings,4,3,"She said, “Your servant has nothing in the house, except a pot of oil.”"
2 Kings,4,4,"Then he said, “Go, borrow empty containers from of all your neighbors. Don’t borrow just a few containers."
2 Kings,4,5,"Go in and shut the door on you and on your sons, and pour oil into all those containers; and set aside those which are full.”"
2 Kings,4,6,"So she went from him, and shut the door on herself and on her sons. They brought the containers to her, and she poured oil."
2 Kings,4,7,"When the containers were full, she said to her son, “Bring me another container.”"
2 Kings,4,8,"He said to her, “There isn’t another container.” Then the oil stopped flowing."
2 Kings,4,9,"Then she came and told the man of God. He said, “Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt; and you and your sons live on the rest.”"
2 Kings,4,10,"One day Elisha went to Shunem, where there was a prominent woman; and she persuaded him to eat bread. So it was, that as often as he passed by, he turned in there to eat bread."
2 Kings,4,11,"She said to her husband, “See now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God who passes by us continually."
2 Kings,4,12,"Please let us make a little room on the roof. Let us set for him there a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp stand. When he comes to us, he can stay there.”"
2 Kings,4,13,"One day he came there, and he went to the room and lay there."
2 Kings,4,14,"He said to Gehazi his servant, “Call this Shunammite.” When he had called her, she stood before him."
2 Kings,4,15,"He said to him, “Say now to her, ‘Behold, you have cared for us with all this care. What is to be done for you? Would you like to be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the army?’”"
2 Kings,4,16,"She answered, “I dwell among my own people.”"
2 Kings,4,17,"He said, “What then is to be done for her?”"
2 Kings,4,18,"Gehazi answered, “Most certainly she has no son, and her husband is old.”"
2 Kings,4,19,"He said, “Call her.” When he had called her, she stood in the door."
2 Kings,4,20,"He said, “At this season, when the time comes around, you will embrace a son.”"
2 Kings,4,21,"She said, “No, my lord, you man of God, do not lie to your servant.”"
2 Kings,4,22,"The woman conceived, and bore a son at that season, when the time came around, as Elisha had said to her."
2 Kings,4,23,"When the child was grown, one day he went out to his father to the reapers."
2 Kings,4,24,"He said to his father, “My head! My head!”"
2 Kings,4,25,"He said to his servant, “Carry him to his mother.”"
2 Kings,4,26,"When he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees until noon, and then died."
2 Kings,4,27,"She went up and laid him on the man of God’s bed, and shut the door on him, and went out."
2 Kings,4,28,"She called to her husband, and said, “Please send me one of the servants, and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.”"
2 Kings,4,29,"He said, “Why would you want go to him today? It is not a new moon or a Sabbath.”"
2 Kings,4,30,"She said, “It’s alright.”"
2 Kings,4,31,"Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, “Drive, and go forward! Don’t slow down for me, unless I ask you to.”"
2 Kings,4,32,"So she went, and came to the man of God to Mount Carmel. When the man of God saw her afar off, he said to Gehazi his servant, “Behold, there is the Shunammite."
2 Kings,4,33,"Please run now to meet her, and ask her, ‘Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with your child?’”"
2 Kings,4,34,"She answered, “It is well.”"
2 Kings,4,35,"When she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, “Leave her alone; for her soul is troubled within her; and Yahweh has hidden it from me, and has not told me.”"
2 Kings,4,36,"Then she said, “Did I ask you for a son, my lord? Didn’t I say, ‘Do not deceive me’?”"
2 Kings,4,37,"Then he said to Gehazi, “Tuck your cloak into your belt, take my staff in your hand, and go your way. If you meet any man, don’t greet him; and if anyone greets you, don’t answer him again. Then lay my staff on the child’s face.”"
2 Kings,4,38,"The child’s mother said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.”"
2 Kings,4,39,"So he arose, and followed her."
2 Kings,4,40,"Gehazi went ahead of them, and laid the staff on the child’s face; but there was no voice and no hearing. Therefore he returned to meet him, and told him, “The child has not awakened.”"
2 Kings,4,41,"When Elisha had come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and lying on his bed."
2 Kings,4,42,"He went in therefore, and shut the door on them both, and prayed to Yahweh."
2 Kings,4,43,"He went up, and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands. He stretched himself on him; and the child’s flesh grew warm."
2 Kings,4,44,"Then he returned, and walked in the house once back and forth; and went up, and stretched himself out on him. Then the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes."
2 Kings,4,45,"He called Gehazi, and said, “Call this Shunammite!” So he called her."
2 Kings,4,46,"When she had come in to him, he said, “Take up your son.”"
2 Kings,4,47,"Then she went in, fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; then she picked up her son, and went out."
2 Kings,4,48,"Elisha came again to Gilgal. There was a famine in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said to his servant, “Get the large pot, and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.”"
2 Kings,4,49,"One went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered a lap full of wild gourds from it, and came and cut them up into the pot of stew; for they didn’t recognize them."
2 Kings,4,50,"So they poured out for the men to eat. As they were eating some of the stew, they cried out, and said, “Man of God, there is death in the pot!” And they could not eat it."
2 Kings,4,51,"But he said, “Then bring meal.” He threw it into the pot; and he said, “Serve it to the people, that they may eat.” And there was nothing harmful in the pot."
2 Kings,4,52,"A man from Baal Shalishah came, and brought the man of God some bread of the first fruits: twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of grain in his sack. He said, “Give to the people, that they may eat.”"
2 Kings,4,53,"His servant said, “What, should I set this before a hundred men?”"
2 Kings,4,54,"But he said, “Give the people, that they may eat; for Yahweh says, ‘They will eat, and will have some left over.’”"
2 Kings,4,55,"So he set it before them, and they ate, and had some left over, according to Yahweh’s word."
2 Kings,4,56,
2 Kings,5,1,"Now Naaman, captain of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him Yahweh had given victory to Syria: he was also a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper."
2 Kings,5,2,"The Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden; and she waited on Naaman’s wife."
2 Kings,5,3,"She said to her mistress, “I wish that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would heal him of his leprosy.”"
2 Kings,5,4,"Someone went in, and told his lord, saying, “The maiden who is from the land of Israel said this.”"
2 Kings,5,5,"The king of Syria said, “Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.”"
2 Kings,5,6,"He departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of clothing."
2 Kings,5,7,"He brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, “Now when this letter has come to you, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may heal him of his leprosy.”"
2 Kings,5,8,"When the king of Israel had read the letter, he tore his clothes, and said, “Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends to me to heal a man of his leprosy? But please consider and see how he seeks a quarrel against me.”"
2 Kings,5,9,"It was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, “Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.”"
2 Kings,5,10,"So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha."
2 Kings,5,11,"Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, “Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall come again to you, and you shall be clean.”"
2 Kings,5,12,"But Naaman was angry, and went away, and said, “Behold, I thought, ‘He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of Yahweh his God, and wave his hand over the place, and heal the leper.’"
2 Kings,5,13,"Aren’t Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Couldn’t I wash in them, and be clean?” So he turned and went away in a rage."
2 Kings,5,14,"His servants came near, and spoke to him, and said, “My father, if the prophet had asked you do some great thing, wouldn’t you have done it? How much rather then, when he says to you, ‘Wash, and be clean?’”"
2 Kings,5,15,"Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean."
2 Kings,5,16,"He returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said, “See now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel. Now therefore, please take a gift from your servant.”"
2 Kings,5,17,"But he said, “As Yahweh lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none.”"
2 Kings,5,18,He urged him to take it; but he refused.
2 Kings,5,19,"Naaman said, “If not, then, please let two mules’ burden of earth be given to your servant; for your servant will from now on offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to Yahweh."
2 Kings,5,20,"In this thing may Yahweh pardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon. When I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, may Yahweh pardon your servant in this thing.”"
2 Kings,5,21,"He said to him, “Go in peace.”"
2 Kings,5,22,So he departed from him a little way.
2 Kings,5,23,"But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, “Behold, my master has spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought. As Yahweh lives, I will run after him, and take something from him.”"
2 Kings,5,24,"So Gehazi followed after Naaman. When Naaman saw one running after him, he came down from the chariot to meet him, and said, “Is all well?”"
2 Kings,5,25,"He said, “All is well. My master has sent me, saying, ‘Behold, even now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothing.’”"
2 Kings,5,26,"Naaman said, “Be pleased to take two talents.” He urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing, and laid them on two of his servants; and they carried them before him."
2 Kings,5,27,"When he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and stored them in the house. Then he let the men go, and they departed."
2 Kings,5,28,"But he went in, and stood before his master. Elisha said to him, “Where did you come from, Gehazi?”"
2 Kings,5,29,"He said, “Your servant went nowhere.”"
2 Kings,5,30,"He said to him, “Didn’t my heart go with you, when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive groves and vineyards, and sheep and cattle, and male servants and female servants?"
2 Kings,5,31,Therefore the leprosy of Naaman will cling to you and to your offspring forever.”
2 Kings,5,32,"He went out from his presence a leper, as white as snow."
2 Kings,5,33,
2 Kings,6,1,"The sons of the prophets said to Elisha, “See now, the place where we live and meet with you is too small for us."
2 Kings,6,2,"Please let us go to the Jordan, and each man take a beam from there, and let us make us a place there, where we may live.”"
2 Kings,6,3,"He answered, “Go!”"
2 Kings,6,4,"One said, “Please be pleased to go with your servants.”"
2 Kings,6,5,"He answered, “I will go.”"
2 Kings,6,6,"So he went with them. When they came to the Jordan, they cut down wood."
2 Kings,6,7,"But as one was cutting down a tree, the ax head fell into the water. Then he cried, and said, “Alas, my master! For it was borrowed.”"
2 Kings,6,8,"The man of God asked, “Where did it fall?” He showed him the place. He cut down a stick, threw it in there, and made the iron float."
2 Kings,6,9,"He said, “Take it.” So he put out his hand and took it."
2 Kings,6,10,"Now the king of Syria was at war against Israel; and he took counsel with his servants, saying, “My camp will be in such and such a place.”"
2 Kings,6,11,"The man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, “Beware that you not pass this place; for the Syrians are coming down there.”"
2 Kings,6,12,"The king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of; and he saved himself there, not once or twice."
2 Kings,6,13,"The king of Syria’s heart was very troubled about this. He called his servants, and said to them, “Won’t you show me which of us is for the king of Israel?”"
2 Kings,6,14,"One of his servants said, “No, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom.”"
2 Kings,6,15,"He said, “Go and see where he is, that I may send and get him.”"
2 Kings,6,16,"He was told, “Behold, he is in Dothan.”"
2 Kings,6,17,"Therefore he sent horses, chariots, and a great army there. They came by night, and surrounded the city."
2 Kings,6,18,"When the servant of the man of God had risen early, and gone out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was around the city. His servant said to him, “Alas, my master! What shall we do?”"
2 Kings,6,19,"He answered, “Don’t be afraid; for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.”"
2 Kings,6,20,"Elisha prayed, and said, “Yahweh, please open his eyes, that he may see.” Yahweh opened the young man’s eyes; and he saw: and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire around Elisha."
2 Kings,6,21,"When they came down to him, Elisha prayed to Yahweh, and said, “Please strike this people with blindness.”"
2 Kings,6,22,He struck them with blindness according to Elishah’s word.
2 Kings,6,23,"Elisha said to them, “This is not the way, neither is this the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.” He led them to Samaria."
2 Kings,6,24,"When they had come into Samaria, Elisha said, “Yahweh, open these men’s eyes, that they may see.”"
2 Kings,6,25,"Yahweh opened their eyes, and they saw; and behold, they were in the middle of Samaria."
2 Kings,6,26,"The king of Israel said to Elisha, when he saw them, “My father, shall I strike them? Shall I strike them?”"
2 Kings,6,27,"He answered, “You shall not strike them. Would you strike those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.”"
2 Kings,6,28,"He prepared a great feast for them. When they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria stopped raiding the land of Israel."
2 Kings,6,29,"After this, Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up and besieged Samaria."
2 Kings,6,30,"There was a great famine in Samaria. Behold, they besieged it, until a donkey’s head was sold for eighty pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of dove’s dung for five pieces of silver."
2 Kings,6,31,"As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried to him, saying, “Help, my lord, O king!”"
2 Kings,6,32,"He said, “If Yahweh doesn’t help you, where could I get help for you? From of the threshing floor, or from the wine press?”"
2 Kings,6,33,"The king said to her, “What is your problem?”"
2 Kings,6,34,"She answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.’"
2 Kings,6,35,"So we boiled my son, and ate him: and I said to her on the next day, ‘Give your son, that we may eat him;’ and she has hidden her son.”"
2 Kings,6,36,"When the king heard the words of the woman, he tore his clothes. Now he was passing by on the wall, and the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth underneath on his body."
2 Kings,6,37,"Then he said, “God do so to me, and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat stays on him today.”"
2 Kings,6,38,"But Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. Then the king sent a man from before him; but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, “Do you see how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head? Behold, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold the door shut against him. Isn’t the sound of his master’s feet behind him?”"
2 Kings,6,39,"While he was still talking with them, behold, the messenger came down to him. Then he said, “Behold, this evil is from Yahweh. Why should I wait for Yahweh any longer?”"
2 Kings,6,40,
2 Kings,7,1,"Elisha said, “Hear Yahweh’s word. Yahweh says, ‘Tomorrow about this time a seah of fine flour will be sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.’”"
2 Kings,7,2,"Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, “Behold, if Yahweh made windows in heaven, could this thing be?”"
2 Kings,7,3,"He said, “Behold, you will see it with your eyes, but will not eat of it.”"
2 Kings,7,4,"Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate. They said to one another, “Why do we sit here until we die?"
2 Kings,7,5,"If we say, ‘We will enter into the city,’ then the famine is in the city, and we will die there. If we sit still here, we also die. Now therefore come, and let us surrender to the army of the Syrians. If they save us alive, we will live; and if they kill us, we will only die.”"
2 Kings,7,6,"They rose up in the twilight, to go to the camp of the Syrians. When they had come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians, behold, no man was there.For the Lord had made the army of the Syrians to hear the sound of chariots, and the sound of horses, even the noise of a great army; and they said to one another, “Behold, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians to attack us.”"
2 Kings,7,7,"Therefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their donkeys, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life."
2 Kings,7,8,"When these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and ate and drink, and carried away silver, gold, and clothing, and went and hid it. Then they came back, and entered into another tent, and carried things from there also, and went and hid them."
2 Kings,7,9,"Then they said to one another, “We aren’t doing right. Today is a day of good news, and we keep silent. If we wait until the morning light, punishment will overtake us. Now therefore come, let’s go and tell the king’s household.”"
2 Kings,7,10,"So they came and called to the city gatekeepers; and they told them, “We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, not even a man’s voice, but the horses tied, and the donkeys tied, and the tents as they were.”"
2 Kings,7,11,He called the gatekeepers; and they told it to the king’s household within.
2 Kings,7,12,"The king arose in the night, and said to his servants, “I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry. Therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, ‘When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive, and get into the city.’”"
2 Kings,7,13,"One of his servants answered, “Please let some people take five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city. Behold, they are like all the multitude of Israel who are left in it. Behold, they are like all the multitude of Israel who are consumed. Let us send and see.”"
2 Kings,7,14,"Therefore they took two chariots with horses; and the king sent them out to the Syrian army, saying, “Go and see.”"
2 Kings,7,15,"They went after them to the Jordan; and behold, all the path was full of garments and equipment which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. The messengers returned, and told the king."
2 Kings,7,16,"The people went out and plundered the camp of the Syrians. So a seah of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to Yahweh’s word."
2 Kings,7,17,"The king appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to be in charge of the gate; and the people trampled over him in the gate, and he died as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him."
2 Kings,7,18,"It happened as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, “Two seahs of barley for a shekel, and a seah of fine flour for a shekel, shall be tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria”;"
2 Kings,7,19,"and that captain answered the man of God, and said, “Now, behold, if Yahweh made windows in heaven, might such a thing be?” and he said, “Behold, you will see it with your eyes, but will not eat of it.”"
2 Kings,7,20,"It happened like that to him; for the people trampled over him in the gate, and he died."
2 Kings,7,21,
2 Kings,8,1,"Now Elisha had spoken to the woman whose son he had restored to life, saying, “Arise, and go, you and your household, and stay for a while wherever you can; for Yahweh has called for a famine. It will also come on the land for seven years.”"
2 Kings,8,2,"The woman arose, and did according to the man of God’s word. She went with her household, and lived in the land of the Philistines for seven years."
2 Kings,8,3,"At the end of seven years, the woman returned from the land of the Philistines. Then she went out to beg the king for her house and for her land."
2 Kings,8,4,"Now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, “Please tell me all the great things that Elisha has done.”"
2 Kings,8,5,"As he was telling the king how he had restored to life him who was dead, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, begged the king for her house and for her land. Gehazi said, “My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.”"
2 Kings,8,6,"When the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed to her a certain officer, saying, “Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.”"
2 Kings,8,7,"Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick. He was told, “The man of God has come here.”"
2 Kings,8,8,"The king said to Hazael, “Take a present in your hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of Yahweh by him, saying, ‘Will I recover from this sickness?’”"
2 Kings,8,9,"So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels’ burden, and came and stood before him, and said, “Your son Benhadad king of Syria has sent me to you, saying, ‘Will I recover from this sickness?’”"
2 Kings,8,10,"Elisha said to him, “Go, tell him, ‘You will surely recover;’ however Yahweh has shown me that he will surely die.”"
2 Kings,8,11,"He settled his gaze steadfastly on him, until he was ashamed. Then the man of God wept."
2 Kings,8,12,"Hazael said, “Why do you weep, my lord?”"
2 Kings,8,13,"He answered, “Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel. You will set their strongholds on fire, and you will kill their young men with the sword, and will dash their little ones in pieces, and rip up their pregnant women.”"
2 Kings,8,14,"Hazael said, “But what is your servant, who is but a dog, that he could do this great thing?”"
2 Kings,8,15,"Elisha answered, “Yahweh has shown me that you will be king over Syria.”"
2 Kings,8,16,"Then he departed from Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him, “What did Elisha say to you?”"
2 Kings,8,17,"He answered, “He told me that you would surely recover.”"
2 Kings,8,18,"On the next day, he took a thick cloth, dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died. Then Hazael reigned in his place."
2 Kings,8,19,"In the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being king of Judah then, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign."
2 Kings,8,20,He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign. He reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
2 Kings,8,21,"He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did Ahab’s house; for he married Ahab’s daughter. He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight."
2 Kings,8,22,"However Yahweh would not destroy Judah, for David his servant’s sake, as he promised him to give to him a lamp for his children always."
2 Kings,8,23,"In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves."
2 Kings,8,24,"Then Joram passed over to Zair, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and struck the Edomites who surrounded him, and the captains of the chariots; and the people fled to their tents."
2 Kings,8,25,So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.
2 Kings,8,26,"The rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,8,27,"Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in David’s city; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place."
2 Kings,8,28,"In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign."
2 Kings,8,29,Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel.
2 Kings,8,30,"He walked in the way of Ahab’s house, and did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, as did Ahab’s house; for he was the son-in-law of Ahab’s house."
2 Kings,8,31,"He went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead, and the Syrians wounded Joram."
2 Kings,8,32,"King Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel from the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick."
2 Kings,8,33,
2 Kings,9,1,"Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and said to him, “Put your belt on your waist, take this vial of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth Gilead."
2 Kings,9,2,"When you come there, find Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him rise up from among his brothers, and take him to an inner room."
2 Kings,9,3,"Then take the vial of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, ‘Yahweh says, “I have anointed you king over Israel.”’ Then open the door, flee, and don’t wait.”"
2 Kings,9,4,"So the young man, even the young man, the prophet, went to Ramoth Gilead."
2 Kings,9,5,"When he came, behold, the captains of the army were sitting. Then he said, “I have a message for you, captain.”"
2 Kings,9,6,"Jehu said, “To which of us all?”"
2 Kings,9,7,"He said, “To you, O captain.”"
2 Kings,9,8,"He arose, and went into the house. Then he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘I have anointed you king over the people of Yahweh, even over Israel."
2 Kings,9,9,"You must strike your master Ahab’s house, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of Yahweh, at the hand of Jezebel."
2 Kings,9,10,"For the whole house of Ahab will perish. I will cut off from Ahab everyone who urinates against a wall, both him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel."
2 Kings,9,11,"I will make Ahab’s house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah."
2 Kings,9,12,"The dogs will eat Jezebel on the plot of ground of Jezreel, and there shall be no one to bury her.’” Then he opened the door and fled."
2 Kings,9,13,"When Jehu came out to the servants of his lord, and one said to him, “Is all well? Why did this mad fellow come to you?”"
2 Kings,9,14,"He said to them, “You know the man and how he talks.”"
2 Kings,9,15,"They said, “That is a lie. Tell us now.”"
2 Kings,9,16,"He said, “He said to me, ‘Yahweh says, I have anointed you king over Israel.’”"
2 Kings,9,17,"Then they hurried, and each man took his cloak, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew the trumpet, saying, “Jehu is king.”"
2 Kings,9,18,"So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram was keeping Ramoth Gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria;"
2 Kings,9,19,"but king Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) Jehu said, “If this is your thinking, then let no one escape and go out of the city, to go to tell it in Jezreel.”"
2 Kings,9,20,"So Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram lay there. Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram."
2 Kings,9,21,"Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, “I see a company.”"
2 Kings,9,22,"Joram said, “Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, ‘Is it peace?’”"
2 Kings,9,23,"So one went on horseback to meet him, and said, “Thus says the king, ‘Is it peace?’”"
2 Kings,9,24,"Jehu said, “What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me!”"
2 Kings,9,25,"The watchman said, “The messenger came to them, but he isn’t coming back.”"
2 Kings,9,26,"Then he sent out a second on horseback, who came to them, and said, “Thus says the king, ‘Is it peace?’”"
2 Kings,9,27,"Jehu answered, “What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me!”"
2 Kings,9,28,"The watchman said, “He came to them, and isn’t coming back. The driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously.”"
2 Kings,9,29,"Joram said, “Get ready!”"
2 Kings,9,30,"They got his chariot ready. Then Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu, and found him on Naboth the Jezreelite’s land."
2 Kings,9,31,"When Joram saw Jehu, he said, “Is it peace, Jehu?”"
2 Kings,9,32,"He answered, “What peace, so long as the prostitution of your mother Jezebel and her witchcraft abound?”"
2 Kings,9,33,"Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, “This is treason, Ahaziah!”"
2 Kings,9,34,"Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and struck Joram between his arms; and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot."
2 Kings,9,35,"Then Jehu said to Bidkar his captain, “Pick him up, and throw him in the plot of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember how, when you and I rode together after Ahab his father, Yahweh laid this burden on him:"
2 Kings,9,36,"‘Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons,’ says Yahweh; ‘and I will repay you in this plot of ground,’ says Yahweh. Now therefore take and cast him onto the plot of ground, according to Yahweh’s word.”"
2 Kings,9,37,"But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. Jehu followed after him, and said, “Strike him also in the chariot!” They struck him at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. He fled to Megiddo, and died there."
2 Kings,9,38,"His servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in David’s city."
2 Kings,9,39,"In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, Ahaziah began to reign over Judah."
2 Kings,9,40,"When Jehu had come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her eyes, and adorned her head, and looked out at the window."
2 Kings,9,41,"As Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, “Do you come in peace, Zimri, you murderer of your master?”"
2 Kings,9,42,"He lifted up his face to the window, and said, “Who is on my side? Who?”"
2 Kings,9,43,Two or three eunuchs looked out at him.
2 Kings,9,44,"He said, “Throw her down!”"
2 Kings,9,45,"So they threw her down; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses. Then he trampled her under foot."
2 Kings,9,46,"When he had come in, he ate and drank. Then he said, “See now to this cursed woman, and bury her; for she is a king’s daughter.”"
2 Kings,9,47,"They went to bury her, but they found no more of her than the skull, the feet, and the palms of her hands."
2 Kings,9,48,"Therefore they came back, and told him."
2 Kings,9,49,"He said, “This is Yahweh’s word, which he spoke by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, ‘The dogs will eat the flesh of Jezebel on the plot of Jezreel,"
2 Kings,9,50,"and the body of Jezebel will be as dung on the face of the field on Jezreel’s land, so that they won’t say, “This is Jezebel.”’”"
2 Kings,9,51,
2 Kings,10,1,"Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, even the elders, and to those who brought up Ahab’s sons, saying,"
2 Kings,10,2,"“Now as soon as this letter comes to you, since your master’s sons are with you, and you have chariots and horses, a fortified city also, and armor,"
2 Kings,10,3,"Select the best and fittest of your master’s sons, set him on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house.”"
2 Kings,10,4,"But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, “Behold, the two kings didn’t stand before him! How then shall we stand?”"
2 Kings,10,5,"He who was over the household, and he who was over the city, the elders also, and those who raised the children, sent to Jehu, saying, “We are your servants, and will do all that you ask us. We will not make any man king. You do that which is good in your eyes.”"
2 Kings,10,6,"Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, “If you are on my side, and if you will listen to my voice, take the heads of the men who are your master’s sons, and come to me to Jezreel by tomorrow this time.”"
2 Kings,10,7,"Now the king’s sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who brought them up."
2 Kings,10,8,"When the letter came to them, they took the king’s sons and killed them, even seventy people, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him to Jezreel."
2 Kings,10,9,"A messenger came and told him, “They have brought the heads of the king’s sons.”"
2 Kings,10,10,"He said, “Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.”"
2 Kings,10,11,"In the morning, he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, “You are righteous. Behold, I conspired against my master and killed him, but who killed all these?"
2 Kings,10,12,"Know now that nothing will fall to the earth of Yahweh’s word, which Yahweh spoke concerning Ahab’s house. For Yahweh has done that which he spoke by his servant Elijah.”"
2 Kings,10,13,"So Jehu struck all that remained of Ahab’s house in Jezreel, with all his great men, his familiar friends, and his priests, until he left him no one remaining."
2 Kings,10,14,"He arose and departed, and went to Samaria. As he was at the shearing house of the shepherds on the way,"
2 Kings,10,15,"Jehu met with the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, “Who are you?”"
2 Kings,10,16,"They answered, “We are the brothers of Ahaziah. We are going down to greet the children of the king and the children of the queen.”"
2 Kings,10,17,"He said, “Take them alive!”"
2 Kings,10,18,"They took them alive, and killed them at the pit of the shearing house, even forty-two men. He didn’t leave any of them."
2 Kings,10,19,"When he had departed from there, he met Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him. He greeted him, and said to him, “Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart?”"
2 Kings,10,20,"Jehonadab answered, “It is.”"
2 Kings,10,21,"“If it is, give me your hand.” He gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot."
2 Kings,10,22,"He said, “Come with me, and see my zeal for Yahweh.” So they made him ride in his chariot."
2 Kings,10,23,"When he came to Samaria, he struck all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, until he had destroyed him, according to Yahweh’s word, which he spoke to Elijah."
2 Kings,10,24,"Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, “Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu will serve him much."
2 Kings,10,25,"Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all of his worshipers, and all of his priests. Let no one be absent; for I have a great sacrifice to Baal. Whoever is absent, he shall not live.” But Jehu did deceptively, intending to destroy the worshipers of Baal."
2 Kings,10,26,"Jehu said, “Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal!”"
2 Kings,10,27,So they proclaimed it.
2 Kings,10,28,"Jehu sent through all Israel; and all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that didn’t come. They came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to another."
2 Kings,10,29,"He said to him who kept the wardrobe, “Bring out robes for all the worshipers of Baal!”"
2 Kings,10,30,So he brought robes out to them.
2 Kings,10,31,"Jehu went with Jehonadab the son of Rechab into the house of Baal. Then he said to the worshipers of Baal, “Search, and see that none of the servants of Yahweh are here with you, but only the worshipers of Baal.”"
2 Kings,10,32,"So they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had appointed for himself eighty men outside, and said, “If any of the men whom I bring into your hands escape, he who lets him go, his life shall be for the life of him.”"
2 Kings,10,33,"As soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, “Go in and kill them! Let no one escape.” So they struck them with the edge of the sword. The guard and the captains threw the bodies out, and went to the inner shrine of the house of Baal."
2 Kings,10,34,"They brought out the pillars that were in the house of Baal, and burned them."
2 Kings,10,35,"They broke down the pillar of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a latrine, to this day."
2 Kings,10,36,Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.
2 Kings,10,37,"However, Jehu didn’t depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin, the golden calves that were in Bethel and that were in Dan."
2 Kings,10,38,"Yahweh said to Jehu, “Because you have done well in executing that which is right in my eyes, and have done to Ahab’s house according to all that was in my heart, your descendants shall sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation.”"
2 Kings,10,39,"But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of Yahweh, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He didn’t depart from the sins of Jeroboam, with which he made Israel to sin."
2 Kings,10,40,In those days Yahweh began to cut away parts of Israel; and Hazael struck them in all the borders of Israel;
2 Kings,10,41,"from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan."
2 Kings,10,42,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
2 Kings,10,43,Jehu slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria. Jehoahaz his son reigned in his place.
2 Kings,10,44,The time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.
2 Kings,10,45,
2 Kings,11,1,"Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal offspring."
2 Kings,11,2,"But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king’s sons who were slain, even him and his nurse, and put them in the bedroom; and they hid him from Athaliah, so that he was not slain."
2 Kings,11,3,He was with her hidden in Yahweh’s house six years while Athaliah reigned over the land.
2 Kings,11,4,"In the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the captains over hundreds of the Carites and of the guard, and brought them to him into Yahweh’s house; and he made a covenant with them, and made a covenant with them in Yahweh’s house, and showed them the king’s son."
2 Kings,11,5,"He commanded them, saying, “This is what you must do: a third of you, who come in on the Sabbath, shall be keepers of the watch of the king’s house;"
2 Kings,11,6,"a third of you shall be at the gate Sur; and a third of you at the gate behind the guard. So you shall keep the watch of the house, and be a barrier."
2 Kings,11,7,"The two companies of you, even all who go out on the Sabbath, shall keep the watch of Yahweh’s house around the king."
2 Kings,11,8,"You shall surround the king, every man with his weapons in his hand; and he who comes within the ranks, let him be slain. Be with the king when he goes out, and when he comes in.”"
2 Kings,11,9,"The captains over hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded; and they each took his men, those who were to come in on the Sabbath, with those who were to go out on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest."
2 Kings,11,10,"The priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spears and shields that had been king David’s, which were in Yahweh’s house."
2 Kings,11,11,"The guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, around the king."
2 Kings,11,12,"Then he brought out the king’s son, and put the crown on him, and gave him the covenant; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, “Long live the king!”"
2 Kings,11,13,"When Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into Yahweh’s house:"
2 Kings,11,14,"and she looked, and behold, the king stood by the pillar, as the tradition was, with the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her clothes, and cried, “Treason! Treason!”"
2 Kings,11,15,"Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them, “Bring her out between the ranks. Kill anyone who follows her with the sword.” For the priest said, “Don’t let her be slain in Yahweh’s house.”"
2 Kings,11,16,"So they made way for her; and she went by the way of the horses’ entry to the king’s house, and she was slain there."
2 Kings,11,17,"Jehoiada made a covenant between Yahweh and the king and the people, that they should be Yahweh’s people; also between the king and the people."
2 Kings,11,18,"All the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and broke it down; his altars and his images broke they in pieces thoroughly, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. The priest appointed officers over Yahweh’s house."
2 Kings,11,19,"He took the captains over hundreds, and the Carites, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from Yahweh’s house, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king’s house. He sat on the throne of the kings."
2 Kings,11,20,"So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. They had slain Athaliah with the sword at the king’s house."
2 Kings,11,21,Jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign.
2 Kings,11,22,
2 Kings,12,1,"Jehoash began to reign in the seventh year of Jehu, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zibiah of Beersheba."
2 Kings,12,2,Jehoash did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes all his days in which Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
2 Kings,12,3,However the high places were not taken away. The people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places.
2 Kings,12,4,"Jehoash said to the priests, “All the money of the holy things that is brought into Yahweh’s house, in current money, the money of the people for whom each man is evaluated, and all the money that it comes into any man’s heart to bring into Yahweh’s house,"
2 Kings,12,5,"let the priests take it to them, each man from his donor; and they shall repair the damage to the house, wherever any damage is found.”"
2 Kings,12,6,"But it was so, that in the twenty-third year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the damage to the house."
2 Kings,12,7,"Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and for the other priests, and said to them, “Why don’t you repair the damage to the house? Now therefore take no more money from your treasurers, but deliver it for repair of the damage to the house.”"
2 Kings,12,8,"The priests consented that they should take no more money from the people, and not repair the damage to the house."
2 Kings,12,9,"But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in its lid, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into Yahweh’s house; and the priests who kept the threshold put all the money that was brought into Yahweh’s house into it."
2 Kings,12,10,"When they saw that there was much money in the chest, the king’s scribe and the high priest came up, and they put it in bags and counted the money that was found in Yahweh’s house."
2 Kings,12,11,"They gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of those who did the work, who had the oversight of Yahweh’s house; and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders, who worked on Yahweh’s house,"
2 Kings,12,12,"and to the masons and the stone cutters, and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the damage to Yahweh’s house, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it."
2 Kings,12,13,"But there were not made for Yahweh’s house cups of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into Yahweh’s house;"
2 Kings,12,14,"for they gave that to those who did the work, and repaired Yahweh’s house with it."
2 Kings,12,15,Moreover they didn’t demand an accounting from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to give to those who did the work; for they dealt faithfully.
2 Kings,12,16,"The money for the trespass offerings, and the money for the sin offerings was not brought into Yahweh’s house. It was the priests’."
2 Kings,12,17,"Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it; and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem."
2 Kings,12,18,"Jehoash king of Judah took all the holy things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own holy things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of Yahweh’s house, and of the king’s house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria; and he went away from Jerusalem."
2 Kings,12,19,"Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,12,20,"His servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and struck Joash at the house of Millo, on the way that goes down to Silla."
2 Kings,12,21,"For Jozacar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, struck him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in David’s city; and Amaziah his son reigned in his place."
2 Kings,12,22,
2 Kings,13,1,"In the twenty-third year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria for seventeen years."
2 Kings,13,2,"He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin. He didn’t depart from it."
2 Kings,13,3,"Yahweh’s anger burned against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, continually."
2 Kings,13,4,"Jehoahaz begged Yahweh, and Yahweh listened to him; for he saw the oppression of Israel, how the king of Syria oppressed them."
2 Kings,13,5,"(Yahweh gave Israel a savior, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians; and the children of Israel lived in their tents as before."
2 Kings,13,6,"Nevertheless they didn’t depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, with which he made Israel to sin, but walked in them; and the Asherah also remained in Samaria.)"
2 Kings,13,7,"For he didn’t leave to Jehoahaz of the people any more than fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria destroyed them, and made them like the dust in threshing."
2 Kings,13,8,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
2 Kings,13,9,Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria; and Joash his son reigned in his place.
2 Kings,13,10,"In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz began to reign over Israel in Samaria for sixteen years."
2 Kings,13,11,"He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight. He didn’t depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin; but he walked in them."
2 Kings,13,12,"Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
2 Kings,13,13,Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat on his throne. Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
2 Kings,13,14,"Now Elisha became sick with the illness of which he died; and Joash the king of Israel came down to him, and wept over him, and said, “My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!”"
2 Kings,13,15,"Elisha said to him, “Take bow and arrows”; and he took bow and arrows for himself."
2 Kings,13,16,"He said to the king of Israel, “Put your hand on the bow”; and he put his hand on it. Elisha laid his hands on the king’s hands."
2 Kings,13,17,"He said, “Open the window eastward”; and he opened it. Then Elisha said, “Shoot!” and he shot. He said, “Yahweh’s arrow of victory, even the arrow of victory over Syria; for you will strike the Syrians in Aphek, until you have consumed them.”"
2 Kings,13,18,"He said, “Take the arrows”; and he took them. He said to the king of Israel, “Strike the ground”; and he struck three times, and stopped."
2 Kings,13,19,"The man of God was angry with him, and said, “You should have struck five or six times. Then you would have struck Syria until you had consumed it; whereas now you will strike Syria just three times.”"
2 Kings,13,20,"Elisha died, and they buried him."
2 Kings,13,21,Now the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.
2 Kings,13,22,"As they were burying a man, behold, they saw a band of raiders; and they threw the man into Elisha’s tomb. As soon as the man touched Elisha’s bones, he revived, and stood up on his feet."
2 Kings,13,23,Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
2 Kings,13,24,"But Yahweh was gracious to them, and had compassion on them, and had respect for them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, and he didn’t cast them from his presence as yet."
2 Kings,13,25,Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his place.
2 Kings,13,26,"Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Joash struck him three times, and recovered the cities of Israel."
2 Kings,13,27,
2 Kings,14,1,In the second year of Joash son of Joahaz king of Israel Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah began to reign.
2 Kings,14,2,He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem.
2 Kings,14,3,"He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, yet not like David his father. He did according to all that Joash his father had done."
2 Kings,14,4,However the high places were not taken away. The people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places.
2 Kings,14,5,"As soon as the kingdom was established in his hand, he killed his servants who had slain the king his father,"
2 Kings,14,6,"but the children of the murderers he didn’t put to death; according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, as Yahweh commanded, saying, “The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin.”"
2 Kings,14,7,"He killed ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt, and took Sela by war, and called its name Joktheel, to this day."
2 Kings,14,8,"Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come, let us look one another in the face.”"
2 Kings,14,9,"Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, “The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son as wife. Then a wild animal that was in Lebanon passed by, and trampled down the thistle."
2 Kings,14,10,"You have indeed struck Edom, and your heart has lifted you up. Enjoy the glory of it, and stay at home; for why should you meddle to your harm, that you fall, even you, and Judah with you?’”"
2 Kings,14,11,"But Amaziah would not listen. So Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah."
2 Kings,14,12,Judah was defeated by Israel; and each man fled to his tent.
2 Kings,14,13,"Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth Shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits."
2 Kings,14,14,"He took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in Yahweh’s house and in the treasures of the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria."
2 Kings,14,15,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
2 Kings,14,16,"Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his place."
2 Kings,14,17,Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.
2 Kings,14,18,"Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"

2 Kings,14,21,"All the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah."

2 Kings,14,24,"He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight. He didn’t depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin."
2 Kings,14,25,"He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath to the sea of the Arabah, according to Yahweh, the God of Israel’s word, which he spoke by his servant Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet, who was from Gath Hepher."
2 Kings,14,26,"For Yahweh saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter; for all, slave and free, and there was no helper for Israel."
2 Kings,14,27,Yahweh didn’t say that he would blot out the name of Israel from under the sky; but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.
2 Kings,14,28,"Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he fought, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, which had belonged to Judah, for Israel, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"

2 Kings,16,4,"He sacrificed and burned incense in the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree."

2 Kings,16,6,"At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath; and the Syrians came to Elath, and lived there, to this day."
2 Kings,16,7,"So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria, saying, “I am your servant and your son. Come up and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me.”"
2 Kings,16,8,"Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in Yahweh’s house, and in the treasures of the king’s house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria."

2 Kings,16,10,"King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria, and saw the altar that was at Damascus; and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest a drawing of the altar and plans to build it."
2 Kings,16,11,"Urijah the priest built an altar. According to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus, so Urijah the priest made it for the coming of king Ahaz from Damascus."
2 Kings,16,12,"When the king had come from Damascus, the king saw the altar; and the king came near to the altar, and offered on it."
2 Kings,16,13,"He burned his burnt offering and his meal offering, poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings on the altar."
2 Kings,16,14,"The bronze altar, which was before Yahweh, he brought from the front of the house, from between his altar and Yahweh’s house, and put it on the north side of his altar."
2 Kings,16,15,"King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, “On the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, the evening meal offering, the king’s burnt offering, his meal offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, their meal offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice; but the bronze altar will be for me to inquire by.”"
2 Kings,16,16,"Urijah the priest did so, according to all that king Ahaz commanded."
2 Kings,16,17,"King Ahaz cut off the panels of the bases, and removed the basin from off them, and took down the sea from off the bronze oxen that were under it, and put it on a pavement of stone."
2 Kings,16,18,"He removed the covered way for the Sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king’s entry outside to Yahweh’s house, because of the king of Assyria."
2 Kings,16,19,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,16,20,"Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in David’s city, and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place."
2 Kings,16,21,
2 Kings,17,1,"In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea the son of Elah began to reign in Samaria over Israel for nine years."
2 Kings,17,2,"He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, yet not as the kings of Israel who were before him."
2 Kings,17,3,"Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against him, and Hoshea became his servant, and brought him tribute."
2 Kings,17,4,"The king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year. Therefore the king of Assyria seized him, and bound him in prison."
2 Kings,17,5,"Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years."
2 Kings,17,6,"In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away to Assyria, and placed them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes."
2 Kings,17,7,"It was so because the children of Israel had sinned against Yahweh their God, who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,"
2 Kings,17,8,"and walked in the statutes of the nations whom Yahweh cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they made."
2 Kings,17,9,"The children of Israel secretly did things that were not right against Yahweh their God; and they built high places for themselves in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city;"
2 Kings,17,10,"and they set up for themselves pillars and Asherah poles on every high hill, and under every green tree;"
2 Kings,17,11,"and there they burned incense in all the high places, as the nations whom Yahweh carried away before them did; and they did wicked things to provoke Yahweh to anger;"
2 Kings,17,12,"and they served idols, of which Yahweh had said to them, “You shall not do this thing.”"
2 Kings,17,13,"Yet Yahweh testified to Israel, and to Judah, by every prophet, and every seer, saying, “Turn from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.”"
2 Kings,17,14,"Notwithstanding, they would not listen, but hardened their neck, like the neck of their fathers, who didn’t believe in Yahweh their God."
2 Kings,17,15,"They rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified to them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and followed the nations that were around them, concerning whom Yahweh had commanded them that they should not do like them."
2 Kings,17,16,"They abandoned all the commandments of Yahweh their God, and made molten images for themselves, even two calves, and made an Asherah, and worshiped all the army of the sky, and served Baal."
2 Kings,17,17,"They caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, to provoke him to anger."
2 Kings,17,18,"Therefore Yahweh was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight. There was none left but the tribe of Judah only."
2 Kings,17,19,"Also Judah didn’t keep the commandments of Yahweh their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made."
2 Kings,17,20,"Yahweh rejected all the offspring of Israel, afflicted them, and delivered them into the hands of raiders, until he had cast them out of his sight."
2 Kings,17,21,"For he tore Israel from David’s house; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king; and Jeroboam drove Israel from following Yahweh, and made them sin a great sin."
2 Kings,17,22,The children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they didn’t depart from them
2 Kings,17,23,"until Yahweh removed Israel out of his sight, as he said by all his servants the prophets. So Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria to this day."
2 Kings,17,24,"The king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, from Cuthah, from Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel; and they possessed Samaria, and lived in its cities."
2 Kings,17,25,"So it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they didn’t fear Yahweh. Therefore Yahweh sent lions among them, which killed some of them."
2 Kings,17,26,"Therefore they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, “The nations which you have carried away and placed in the cities of Samaria don’t know the law of the god of the land. Therefore he has sent lions among them, and behold, they kill them, because they don’t know the law of the god of the land.”"
2 Kings,17,27,"Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, “Carry there one of the priests whom you brought from there; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the law of the god of the land.”"
2 Kings,17,28,"So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and lived in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear Yahweh."
2 Kings,17,29,"However every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities in which they lived."
2 Kings,17,30,"The men of Babylon made Succoth Benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,"
2 Kings,17,31,"and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim."
2 Kings,17,32,"So they feared Yahweh, and also made from among themselves priests of the high places for themselves, who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places."
2 Kings,17,33,"They feared Yahweh, and also served their own gods, after the ways of the nations from among whom they had been carried away."
2 Kings,17,34,"To this day they do what they did before. They don’t fear Yahweh, and they do not follow the statutes, or the ordinances, or the law, or the commandment which Yahweh commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;"
2 Kings,17,35,"with whom Yahweh had made a covenant, and commanded them, saying, “You shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them;"
2 Kings,17,36,"but you shall fear Yahweh, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm, and you shall bow yourselves to him, and you shall sacrifice to him."
2 Kings,17,37,"The statutes and the ordinances, and the law and the commandment, which he wrote for you, you shall observe to do forever more. You shall not fear other gods."
2 Kings,17,38,You shall not forget the covenant that I have made with you. You shall not fear other gods.
2 Kings,17,39,"But you shall fear Yahweh your God, and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.”"
2 Kings,17,40,"However they did not listen, but they did what they did before."
2 Kings,17,41,"So these nations feared Yahweh, and also served their engraved images. Their children likewise, and their children’s children, as their fathers did, so they do to this day."
2 Kings,17,42,
2 Kings,18,1,"Now in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign."
2 Kings,18,2,"He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah."
2 Kings,18,3,"He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, according to all that David his father had done."
2 Kings,18,4,"He removed the high places, and broke the pillars, and cut down the Asherah. He also broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made, because in those days the children of Israel burned incense to it; and he called it Nehushtan."
2 Kings,18,5,"He trusted in Yahweh, the God of Israel; so that after him was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, nor among them that were before him."
2 Kings,18,6,"For he joined with Yahweh. He didn’t depart from following him, but kept his commandments, which Yahweh commanded Moses."
2 Kings,18,7,"Yahweh was with him. Wherever he went, he prospered. He rebelled against the king of Assyria, and didn’t serve him."
2 Kings,18,8,"He struck the Philistines to Gaza and its borders, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city."
2 Kings,18,9,"In the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it."
2 Kings,18,10,"At the end of three years they took it. In the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken."
2 Kings,18,11,"The king of Assyria carried Israel away to Assyria, and put them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,"
2 Kings,18,12,"because they didn’t obey Yahweh their God’s voice, but transgressed his covenant, even all that Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded, and would not hear it or do it."
2 Kings,18,13,"Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them."
2 Kings,18,14,"Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, “I have offended you. Return from me. That which you put on me, I will bear.” The king of Assyria appointed to Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold."
2 Kings,18,15,"Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in Yahweh’s house, and in the treasures of the king’s house."
2 Kings,18,16,"At that time, Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of Yahweh’s temple, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria."
2 Kings,18,17,"The king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army to Jerusalem. They went up and came to Jerusalem. When they had come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller’s field."
2 Kings,18,18,"When they had called to the king, Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder came out to them."
2 Kings,18,19,"Rabshakeh said to them, “Say now to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, “What confidence is this in which you trust?"
2 Kings,18,20,"You say (but they are but vain words), ‘There is counsel and strength for war.’ Now on whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me?"
2 Kings,18,21,"Now, behold, you trust in the staff of this bruised reed, even in Egypt. If a man leans on it, it will go into his hand, and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust on him."
2 Kings,18,22,"But if you tell me, ‘We trust in Yahweh our God;’ isn’t that he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, ‘You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?’"
2 Kings,18,23,"Now therefore, please give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them."
2 Kings,18,24,"How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?"
2 Kings,18,25,"Have I now come up without Yahweh against this place to destroy it? Yahweh said to me, ‘Go up against this land, and destroy it.’”’”"
2 Kings,18,26,"Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, Shebnah, and Joah, said to Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in the Syrian language, for we understand it. Don’t speak with us in the Jews’ language, in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.”"
2 Kings,18,27,"But Rabshakeh said to them, “Has my master sent me to your master and to you, to speak these words? Hasn’t he sent me to the men who sit on the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own urine with you?”"
2 Kings,18,28,"Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and spoke, saying, “Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria."
2 Kings,18,29,"Thus says the king, ‘Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand."
2 Kings,18,30,"Don’t let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh, saying, “Yahweh will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.”"
2 Kings,18,31,"Don’t listen to Hezekiah.’ For thus says the king of Assyria, ‘Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and everyone of you eat from his own vine, and everyone from his own fig tree, and everyone drink water from his own cistern;"
2 Kings,18,32,"until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and of honey, that you may live, and not die. Don’t listen to Hezekiah, when he persuades you, saying, “Yahweh will deliver us.”"
2 Kings,18,33,Has any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
2 Kings,18,34,"Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?"
2 Kings,18,35,"Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Yahweh should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?’”"
2 Kings,18,36,"But the people stayed quiet, and answered him not a word; for the king’s commandment was, “Don’t answer him.”"
2 Kings,18,37,"Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, came with Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him Rabshakeh’s words."
2 Kings,18,38,
2 Kings,19,1,"When king Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into Yahweh’s house."
2 Kings,19,2,"He sent Eliakim, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz."
2 Kings,19,3,"They said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah, ‘Today is a day of trouble, of rebuke, and of rejection; for the children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to deliver them."
2 Kings,19,4,"It may be Yahweh your God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Yahweh your God has heard. Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.’”"
2 Kings,19,5,So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
2 Kings,19,6,"Isaiah said to them, “Tell your master this: ‘Yahweh says, “Don’t be afraid of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me."
2 Kings,19,7,"Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he will hear news, and will return to his own land. I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.”’”"
2 Kings,19,8,So Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.
2 Kings,19,9,"When he heard it said of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, “Behold, he has come out to fight against you, he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,"
2 Kings,19,10,"‘Tell Hezekiah king of Judah this: “Don’t let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria."
2 Kings,19,11,"Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly. Will you be delivered?"
2 Kings,19,12,"Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the children of Eden who were in Telassar?"
2 Kings,19,13,"Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?”’”"
2 Kings,19,14,"Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it. Then Hezekiah went up to Yahweh’s house, and spread it before Yahweh."
2 Kings,19,15,"Hezekiah prayed before Yahweh, and said, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, who sit above the cherubim, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth."
2 Kings,19,16,"Incline your ear, Yahweh, and hear. Open your eyes, Yahweh, and see. Hear the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to defy the living God."
2 Kings,19,17,"Truly, Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands,"
2 Kings,19,18,"and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone. Therefore they have destroyed them."
2 Kings,19,19,"Now therefore, Yahweh our God, save us, I beg you, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, Yahweh, are God alone.”"
2 Kings,19,20,"Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says ‘You have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, and I have heard you."
2 Kings,19,21,This is the word that Yahweh has spoken concerning him: ‘The virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and ridiculed you. The daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.
2 Kings,19,22,Whom have you defied and blasphemed? Against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel!
2 Kings,19,23,"By your messengers, you have defied the Lord, and have said, “With the multitude of my chariots, I have come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon, and I will cut down its tall cedars and its choice cypress trees; and I will enter into his farthest lodging place, the forest of his fruitful field."
2 Kings,19,24,"I have dug and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt.”"
2 Kings,19,25,"Haven’t you heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? Now I have brought it to pass, that it should be yours to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps."
2 Kings,19,26,"Therefore their inhabitants had little power. They were dismayed and confounded. They were like the grass of the field, and like the green herb, like the grass on the housetops, and like grain blasted before it has grown up."
2 Kings,19,27,"But I know your sitting down, your going out, your coming in, and your raging against me."
2 Kings,19,28,"Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance has come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in your nose, and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.’"
2 Kings,19,29,"“This will be the sign to you: This year, you will eat that which grows of itself, and in the second year that which springs of the same; and in the third year sow, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat its fruit."
2 Kings,19,30,"The remnant that has escaped of the house of Judah will again take root downward, and bear fruit upward."
2 Kings,19,31,"For out of Jerusalem a remnant will go out, and out of Mount Zion those who shall escape. Yahweh’s zeal will perform this."
2 Kings,19,32,"“Therefore Yahweh says concerning the king of Assyria, ‘He will not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there. He will not come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it."
2 Kings,19,33,"By the way that he came, by the same he will return, and he will not come to this city,’ says Yahweh."
2 Kings,19,34,"‘For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.’”"
2 Kings,19,35,"That night, Yahweh’s angel went out, and struck one hundred eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians. When men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies."
2 Kings,19,36,"So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and lived at Nineveh."
2 Kings,19,37,"As he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. Esar Haddon his son reigned in his place."
2 Kings,19,38,
2 Kings,20,1,"In those days Hezekiah was sick and dying. Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, “Yahweh says, ‘Set your house in order; for you will die, and not live.’”"
2 Kings,20,2,"Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed to Yahweh, saying,"
2 Kings,20,3,"“Remember now, Yahweh, I beg you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly."
2 Kings,20,4,"Before Isaiah had gone out into the middle part of the city, Yahweh’s word came to him, saying,"
2 Kings,20,5,"“Turn back, and tell Hezekiah the prince of my people, ‘Yahweh, the God of David your father, says, “I have heard your prayer. I have seen your tears. Behold, I will heal you. On the third day, you will go up to Yahweh’s house."
2 Kings,20,6,"I will add to your days fifteen years. I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city for my own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.”’”"
2 Kings,20,7,"Isaiah said, “Take a cake of figs.”"
2 Kings,20,8,"They took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered."
2 Kings,20,9,"Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “What will be the sign that Yahweh will heal me, and that I will go up to Yahweh’s house the third day?”"
2 Kings,20,10,"Isaiah said, “This will be the sign to you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will do the thing that he has spoken: should the shadow go forward ten steps, or go back ten steps?”"
2 Kings,20,11,"Hezekiah answered, “It is a light thing for the shadow to go forward ten steps. No, but let the shadow return backward ten steps.”"
2 Kings,20,12,"Isaiah the prophet cried to Yahweh; and he brought the shadow ten steps backward, by which it had gone down on the sundial of Ahaz."
2 Kings,20,13,"At that time Berodach Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick."
2 Kings,20,14,"Hezekiah listened to them, and showed them all the storehouse of his precious things, the silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil, and the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures. There was nothing in his house, or in all his dominion, that Hezekiah didn’t show them."
2 Kings,20,15,"Then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah, and said to him, “What did these men say? From where did they come to you?”"
2 Kings,20,16,"Hezekiah said, “They have come from a far country, even from Babylon.”"
2 Kings,20,17,"He said, “What have they seen in your house?”"
2 Kings,20,18,"Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house. There is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.”"
2 Kings,20,19,"Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear Yahweh’s word."
2 Kings,20,20,"‘Behold, the days come that all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have laid up in store to this day, will be carried to Babylon. Nothing will be left,’ says Yahweh."
2 Kings,20,21,"‘They will take away some of your sons who will issue from you, whom you will father; and they will be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.’”"
2 Kings,20,22,"Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “Yahweh’s word which you have spoken is good.” He said moreover, “Isn’t it so, if peace and truth will be in my days?”"
2 Kings,20,23,"Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made the pool, and the conduit, and brought water into the city, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,20,24,"Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and Manasseh his son reigned in his place."
2 Kings,20,25,
2 Kings,21,1,"Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hephzibah."
2 Kings,21,2,"He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, after the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel."
2 Kings,21,3,"For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he raised up altars for Baal, and made an Asherah, as Ahab king of Israel did, and worshiped all the army of the sky, and served them."
2 Kings,21,4,"He built altars in Yahweh’s house, of which Yahweh said, “I will put my name in Jerusalem.”"
2 Kings,21,5,He built altars for all the army of the sky in the two courts of Yahweh’s house.
2 Kings,21,6,"He made his son to pass through the fire, practiced sorcery, used enchantments, and dealt with those who had familiar spirits, and with wizards. He did much evil in Yahweh’s sight, to provoke him to anger."
2 Kings,21,7,"He set the engraved image of Asherah that he had made in the house of which Yahweh said to David and to Solomon his son, “In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name forever;"
2 Kings,21,8,"I will not cause the feet of Israel to wander any more out of the land which I gave their fathers, if only they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.”"
2 Kings,21,9,"But they didn’t listen, and Manasseh seduced them to do that which is evil more than the nations did whom Yahweh destroyed before the children of Israel."
2 Kings,21,10,"Yahweh spoke by his servants the prophets, saying,"
2 Kings,21,11,"“Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations, and has done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, who were before him, and has also made Judah to sin with his idols;"
2 Kings,21,12,"therefore Yahweh the God of Israel says, ‘Behold, I bring such evil on Jerusalem and Judah that whoever hears of it, both his ears will tingle."
2 Kings,21,13,"I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of Ahab’s house; and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down."
2 Kings,21,14,"I will cast off the remnant of my inheritance, and deliver them into the hands of their enemies. They will become a prey and a plunder to all their enemies,"
2 Kings,21,15,"because they have done that which is evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came out of Egypt, even to this day.’”"
2 Kings,21,16,"Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; besides his sin with which he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight."
2 Kings,21,17,"Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,21,18,"Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza; and Amon his son reigned in his place."
2 Kings,21,19,Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
2 Kings,21,20,"He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, as Manasseh his father did."
2 Kings,21,21,"He walked in all the ways that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshiped them;"
2 Kings,21,22,"and he abandoned Yahweh, the God of his fathers, and didn’t walk in the way of Yahweh."
2 Kings,21,23,"The servants of Amon conspired against him, and put the king to death in his own house."
2 Kings,21,24,But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place.
2 Kings,21,25,"Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,21,26,"He was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza, and Josiah his son reigned in his place."
2 Kings,21,27,
2 Kings,22,1,"Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath."
2 Kings,22,2,"He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, and walked in all the way of David his father, and didn’t turn away to the right hand or to the left."
2 Kings,22,3,"In the eighteenth year of king Josiah, the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to Yahweh’s house, saying,"
2 Kings,22,4,"“Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may count the money which is brought into Yahweh’s house, which the keepers of the threshold have gathered of the people."
2 Kings,22,5,"Let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of Yahweh’s house; and let them give it to the workmen who are in Yahweh’s house, to repair the damage to the house,"
2 Kings,22,6,"to the carpenters, and to the builders, and to the masons, and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the house."
2 Kings,22,7,However there was no accounting made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand; for they dealt faithfully.”
2 Kings,22,8,"Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the book of the law in Yahweh’s house.” Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan, and he read it."
2 Kings,22,9,"Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, “Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hands of the workmen who have the oversight of Yahweh’s house.”"
2 Kings,22,10,"Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, “Hilkiah the priest has delivered a book to me.” Then Shaphan read it before the king."
2 Kings,22,11,"When the king had heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes."
2 Kings,22,12,"The king commanded Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Achbor the son of Micaiah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying,"
2 Kings,22,13,"“Go inquire of Yahweh for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found; for great is Yahweh’s wrath that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not listened to the words of this book, to do according to all that which is written concerning us.”"
2 Kings,22,14,"So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter); and they talked with her."
2 Kings,22,15,"She said to them, “Yahweh the God of Israel says, ‘Tell the man who sent you to me,"
2 Kings,22,16,"“Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will bring evil on this place, and on its inhabitants, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read."
2 Kings,22,17,"Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and it will not be quenched.’”"
2 Kings,22,18,"But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Yahweh, tell him, “Yahweh the God of Israel says, ‘Concerning the words which you have heard,"
2 Kings,22,19,"because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before Yahweh, when you heard what I spoke against this place, and against its inhabitants, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and have torn your clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard you,’ says Yahweh."
2 Kings,22,20,"‘Therefore behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace. Your eyes will not see all the evil which I will bring on this place.’”’” So they brought this message back to the king."
2 Kings,22,21,
2 Kings,23,1,"The king sent, and they gathered to him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem."
2 Kings,23,2,"The king went up to Yahweh’s house, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, with the priests, the prophets, and all the people, both small and great; and he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in Yahweh’s house."
2 Kings,23,3,"The king stood by the pillar, and made a covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh, and to keep his commandments, his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and all his soul, to confirm the words of this covenant that were written in this book; and all the people agreed to the covenant."
2 Kings,23,4,"The king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the threshold, to bring out of Yahweh’s temple all the vessels that were made for Baal, for the Asherah, and for all the army of the sky, and he burned them outside of Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and carried their ashes to Bethel."
2 Kings,23,5,"He got rid of the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places around Jerusalem; those also who burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the army of the sky."
2 Kings,23,6,"He brought out the Asherah from Yahweh’s house, outside of Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and beat it to dust, and cast its dust on the graves of the common people."
2 Kings,23,7,"He broke down the houses of the male shrine prostitutes that were in Yahweh’s house, where the women wove hangings for the Asherah."
2 Kings,23,8,"He brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba; and he broke down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man’s left hand at the gate of the city."
2 Kings,23,9,"Nevertheless the priests of the high places didn’t come up to Yahweh’s altar in Jerusalem, but they ate unleavened bread among their brothers."
2 Kings,23,10,"He defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech."
2 Kings,23,11,"He took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of Yahweh’s house, by the room of Nathan Melech the officer, who was in the court; and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire."
2 Kings,23,12,"The king broke down the altars that were on the roof of the upper room of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of Yahweh’s house, and beat them down from there, and cast their dust into the brook Kidron."
2 Kings,23,13,"The king defiled the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mountain of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon."
2 Kings,23,14,"He broke in pieces the pillars, cut down the Asherah poles, and filled their places with men’s bones."
2 Kings,23,15,"Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he broke down; and he burned the high place and beat it to dust, and burned the Asherah."
2 Kings,23,16,"As Josiah turned himself, he spied the tombs that were there in the mountain; and he sent, and took the bones out of the tombs, and burned them on the altar, and defiled it, according to Yahweh’s word which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these things."
2 Kings,23,17,"Then he said, “What monument is that which I see?”"
2 Kings,23,18,"The men of the city told him, “It is the tomb of the man of God, who came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that you have done against the altar of Bethel.”"
2 Kings,23,19,"He said, “Let him be! Let no one move his bones.” So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet who came out of Samaria."
2 Kings,23,20,"All the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke Yahweh to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel."
2 Kings,23,21,"He killed all the priests of the high places that were there, on the altars, and burned men’s bones on them; and he returned to Jerusalem."
2 Kings,23,22,"The king commanded all the people, saying, “Keep the Passover to Yahweh your God, as it is written in this book of the covenant.”"
2 Kings,23,23,"Surely there was not kept such a Passover from the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;"
2 Kings,23,24,"but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, this Passover was kept to Yahweh in Jerusalem."
2 Kings,23,25,"Moreover Josiah removed those who had familiar spirits, the wizards, and the teraphim, and the idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, that he might confirm the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in Yahweh’s house."
2 Kings,23,26,"There was no king like him before him, who turned to Yahweh with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; and there was none like him who arose after him."
2 Kings,23,27,"Notwithstanding, Yahweh didn’t turn from the fierceness of his great wrath, with which his anger burned against Judah, because of all the provocation with which Manasseh had provoked him."
2 Kings,23,28,"Yahweh said, “I will also remove Judah out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and I will cast off this city which I have chosen, even Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, ‘My name shall be there.’”"
2 Kings,23,29,"Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,23,30,"In his days Pharaoh Necoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates; and king Josiah went against him; and Pharaoh Necoh killed him at Megiddo, when he had seen him."
2 Kings,23,31,"His servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb. The people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father’s place."
2 Kings,23,32,Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
2 Kings,23,33,"He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, according to all that his fathers had done."
2 Kings,23,34,"Pharaoh Necoh put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of one hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold."
2 Kings,23,35,"Pharaoh Necoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the place of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim; but he took Jehoahaz away, and he came to Egypt and died there."
2 Kings,23,36,"Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh. He exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, from everyone according to his assessment, to give it to Pharaoh Necoh."
2 Kings,23,37,"Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah."
2 Kings,23,38,"He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, according to all that his fathers had done."
2 Kings,23,39,
2 Kings,24,1,"In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years. Then he turned and rebelled against him."
2 Kings,24,2,"Yahweh sent against him bands of the Chaldeans, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to Yahweh’s word, which he spoke by his servants the prophets."
2 Kings,24,3,"Surely at the commandment of Yahweh this came on Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did,"
2 Kings,24,4,"and also for the innocent blood that he shed; for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and Yahweh would not pardon."
2 Kings,24,5,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,24,6,"So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers, and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place."
2 Kings,24,7,"The king of Egypt didn’t come out of his land any more; for the king of Babylon had taken, from the brook of Egypt to the river Euphrates, all that belonged to the king of Egypt."
2 Kings,24,8,"Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mother’s name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem."
2 Kings,24,9,"He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, according to all that his father had done."
2 Kings,24,10,"At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged."
2 Kings,24,11,"Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to the city while his servants were besieging it,"
2 Kings,24,12,"and Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers; and the king of Babylon captured him in the eighth year of his reign."
2 Kings,24,13,"He carried out from there all the treasures of Yahweh’s house, and the treasures of the king’s house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold, which Solomon king of Israel had made in Yahweh’s temple, as Yahweh had said."
2 Kings,24,14,"He carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths. No one remained, except the poorest people of the land."
2 Kings,24,15,"He carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, with the king’s mother, the king’s wives, his officers, and the chief men of the land. He carried them into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon."
2 Kings,24,16,"All the men of might, even seven thousand, and the craftsmen and the smiths one thousand, all of them strong and fit for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon."
2 Kings,24,17,"The king of Babylon made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin’s father’s brother, king in his place, and changed his name to Zedekiah."
2 Kings,24,18,"Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah."
2 Kings,24,19,"He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, according to all that Jehoiakim had done."
2 Kings,24,20,"For through the anger of Yahweh, this happened in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence."
2 Kings,24,21,Then Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
2 Kings,24,22,
2 Kings,25,1,"In the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it around it."
2 Kings,25,2,So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
2 Kings,25,3,"On the ninth day of the fourth month, the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land."
2 Kings,25,4,"Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden (now the Chaldeans were against the city around it); and the king went by the way of the Arabah."
2 Kings,25,5,"But the Chaldean army pursued the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him."
2 Kings,25,6,"Then they captured the king, and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they passed judgment on him."
2 Kings,25,7,"They killed Zedekiah’s sons before his eyes, then put out Zedekiah’s eyes, bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon."
2 Kings,25,8,"Now in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem."
2 Kings,25,9,"He burned Yahweh’s house, the king’s house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, he burned with fire."
2 Kings,25,10,"All the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls around Jerusalem."
2 Kings,25,11,"Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive the residue of the people who were left in the city, and those who fell away, who fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude."
2 Kings,25,12,But the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to work the vineyards and fields.
2 Kings,25,13,"The Chaldeans broke up the pillars of brass that were in Yahweh’s house and the bases and the bronze sea that were in Yahweh’s house, and carried the brass pieces to Babylon."
2 Kings,25,14,"They took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered."
2 Kings,25,15,"The captain of the guard took away the fire pans, the basins, that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver."
2 Kings,25,16,"The two pillars, the one sea, and the bases, which Solomon had made for Yahweh’s house, the brass of all these vessels was not weighed."
2 Kings,25,17,"The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a capital of brass was on it. The height of the capital was three cubits, with network and pomegranates on the capital around it, all of brass; and the second pillar with its network was like these."
2 Kings,25,18,"The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold;"
2 Kings,25,19,"and out of the city he took an officer who was set over the men of war; and five men of those who saw the king’s face, who were found in the city; and the scribe, the captain of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the city."
2 Kings,25,20,"Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah."
2 Kings,25,21,"The king of Babylon attacked them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land."
2 Kings,25,22,"As for the people who were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor."
2 Kings,25,23,"Now when all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men."
2 Kings,25,24,"Gedaliah swore to them and to their men, and said to them, “Don’t be afraid because of the servants of the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you.”"
2 Kings,25,25,"But in the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal offspring came, and ten men with him, and struck Gedaliah, so that he died, with the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah."
2 Kings,25,26,"All the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces, arose, and came to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans."
2 Kings,25,27,"In the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, Evilmerodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;"
2 Kings,25,28,"and he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon,"
2 Kings,25,29,and changed his prison garments. Jehoiachin ate bread before him continually all the days of his life;
2 Kings,25,30,"and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him from the king, every day a portion, all the days of his life."

1 Chronicles,18,10,"he sent Hadoram his son to king David, to Greet him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him (for Hadadezer had wars with Tou); and he had with him all kinds of vessels of gold and silver and brass."

1 Chronicles,19,2,"David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.”"
1 Chronicles,19,3,"So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him."
1 Chronicles,19,4,"But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, “Do you think that David honors your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Haven’t his servants come to you to search, to overthrow, and to spy out the land?”"
1 Chronicles,19,5,"So Hanun took David’s servants, shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle at their buttocks, and sent them away."
1 Chronicles,19,6,"Then some people went and told David how the men were treated. He sent to meet them; for the men were greatly humiliated. The king said, “Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.”"
1 Chronicles,19,7,"When the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent one thousand talents of silver to hire chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, out of Aram-maacah, and out of Zobah."
1 Chronicles,19,8,"So they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah with his people, who came and encamped near Medeba. The children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle."
1 Chronicles,19,9,"When David heard of it, he sent Joab with all the army of the mighty men."
1 Chronicles,19,10,"The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the gate of the city; and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field."
1 Chronicles,19,11,"Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose some of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians."
1 Chronicles,19,12,The rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon.
1 Chronicles,19,13,"He said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you are to help me; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you."
1 Chronicles,19,14,"Be courageous, and let us be strong for our people and for the cities of our God. May Yahweh do that which seems good to him.”"
1 Chronicles,19,15,So Joab and the people who were with him came near to the front of the Syrians to the battle; and they fled before him.
1 Chronicles,19,16,"When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem."

1 Chronicles,20,2,"David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it. It was set on David’s head, and he brought very much plunder out of the city."
1 Chronicles,20,3,"He brought out the people who were in it, and had them cut with saws, with iron picks, and with axes. David did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,20,4,"After this, war arose at Gezer with the Philistines. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, of the sons of the giant; and they were subdued."

1 Chronicles,21,1,"Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to take a census of Israel."
1 Chronicles,21,2,"David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, “Go, count Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know how many there are.”"
1 Chronicles,21,3,"Joab said, “May Yahweh make his people a hundred times as many as they are. But, my lord the king, aren’t they all my lord’s servants? Why does my lord require this thing? Why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel?”"
1 Chronicles,21,4,"Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, then came to Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,21,5,Joab gave up the sum of the census of the people to David. All those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew a sword; and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew a sword.
1 Chronicles,21,6,But he didn’t count Levi and Benjamin among them; for the king’s word was abominable to Joab.
1 Chronicles,21,7,God was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Israel.
1 Chronicles,21,8,"David said to God, “I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing. But now put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.”"
1 Chronicles,21,9,"Yahweh spoke to Gad, David’s seer, saying,"
1 Chronicles,21,10,"“Go and speak to David, saying, ‘Yahweh says, “I offer you three things. Choose one of them, that I may do it to you.”’”"
1 Chronicles,21,11,"So Gad came to David, and said to him, “Yahweh says, ‘Take your choice:"
1 Chronicles,21,12,"either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or else three days the sword of Yahweh, even pestilence in the land, and Yahweh’s angel destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.’”"
1 Chronicles,21,13,"David said to Gad, “I am in distress. Let me fall, I pray, into Yahweh’s hand; for his mercies are very great. Don’t let me fall into man’s hand.”"
1 Chronicles,21,14,"So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell."
1 Chronicles,21,15,"God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As he was about to destroy, Yahweh saw, and he relented of the disaster, and said to the destroying angel, “It is enough. Now withdraw your hand.” Yahweh’s angel was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite."
1 Chronicles,21,16,"David lifted up his eyes, and saw Yahweh’s angel standing between earth and the sky, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,21,17,"Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces."
1 Chronicles,21,18,"David said to God, “Isn’t it I who commanded the people to be counted? It is even I who have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O Yahweh my God, be against me, and against my father’s house; but not against your people, that they should be plagued.”"
1 Chronicles,21,19,Then Yahweh’s angel commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up and raise an altar to Yahweh on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
1 Chronicles,21,20,"David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in Yahweh’s name."
1 Chronicles,21,21,"Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat."
1 Chronicles,21,22,"As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground."
1 Chronicles,21,23,"Then David said to Ornan, “Give me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar to Yahweh on it. You shall sell it to me for the full price, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people.”"
1 Chronicles,21,24,"Ornan said to David, “Take it for yourself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes. Behold, I give the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering. I give it all.”"
1 Chronicles,21,25,"King David said to Ornan, “No; but I will most certainly buy it for the full price. For I will not take that which is yours for Yahweh, nor offer a burnt offering that costs me nothing.”"
1 Chronicles,21,26,So David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place.
1 Chronicles,21,27,"David built an altar to Yahweh there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on Yahweh; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering."
1 Chronicles,21,28,"Then Yahweh commanded the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath."
1 Chronicles,21,29,"At that time, when David saw that Yahweh had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there."
1 Chronicles,21,30,"For Yahweh’s tabernacle, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon."
1 Chronicles,21,31,But David couldn’t go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of Yahweh’s angel.
1 Chronicles,21,32,
1 Chronicles,22,1,"Then David said, “This is the house of Yahweh God, and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel.”"
1 Chronicles,22,2,David gave orders to gather together the foreigners who were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to cut dressed stones to build God’s house.
1 Chronicles,22,3,"David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings; and brass in abundance without weight;"
1 Chronicles,22,4,"and cedar trees without number, for the Sidonians and the people of Tyre brought cedar trees in abundance to David."
1 Chronicles,22,5,"David said, “Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for Yahweh must be exceedingly magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries. I will therefore make preparation for it.” So David prepared abundantly before his death."
1 Chronicles,22,6,"Then he called for Solomon his son, and commanded him to build a house for Yahweh, the God of Israel."
1 Chronicles,22,7,"David said to Solomon his son, “As for me, it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Yahweh my God."
1 Chronicles,22,8,"But Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ‘You have shed blood abundantly, and have made great wars. You shall not build a house to my name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight."
1 Chronicles,22,9,"Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of peace. I will give him rest from all his enemies all around; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days."
1 Chronicles,22,10,"He shall build a house for my name; and he will be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.’"
1 Chronicles,22,11,"Now, my son, may Yahweh be with you and prosper you, and build the house of Yahweh your God, as he has spoken concerning you."
1 Chronicles,22,12,"May Yahweh give you discretion and understanding, and put you in charge of Israel; that so you may keep the law of Yahweh your God."
1 Chronicles,22,13,"Then you will prosper, if you observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Yahweh gave Moses concerning Israel. Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid, and don’t be dismayed."
1 Chronicles,22,14,"Now, behold, in my affliction I have prepared for Yahweh’s house one hundred thousand talents of gold, one million talents of silver, and brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance. I have also prepared timber and stone; and you may add to them."
1 Chronicles,22,15,"There are also workmen with you in abundance, cutters and workers of stone and timber, and all kinds of men who are skillful in every kind of work;"
1 Chronicles,22,16,"of the gold, the silver, the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and may Yahweh be with you.”"
1 Chronicles,22,17,"David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,"
1 Chronicles,22,18,"“Isn’t Yahweh your God with you? Hasn’t he given you rest on every side? For he has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before Yahweh, and before his people."
1 Chronicles,22,19,"Now set your heart and your soul to follow Yahweh your God. Arise therefore, and build the sanctuary of Yahweh God, to bring the ark of Yahweh’s covenant and the holy vessels of God into the house that is to be built for Yahweh’s name.”"
1 Chronicles,22,20,
1 Chronicles,23,1,Now David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel.
1 Chronicles,23,2,"He gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites."
1 Chronicles,23,3,"The Levites were counted from thirty years old and upward; and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty-eight thousand."
1 Chronicles,23,4,"David said, “Of these, twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of Yahweh’s house, six thousand were officers and judges,"
1 Chronicles,23,5,"four thousand were doorkeepers, and four thousand praised Yahweh with the instruments which I made for giving praise.”"

1 Chronicles,23,11,"Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah didn’t have many sons; therefore they became a fathers’ house in one reckoning."
1 Chronicles,23,12,"The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four."
1 Chronicles,23,13,"The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons, forever, to burn incense before Yahweh, to minister to him, and to bless in his name, forever."

1 Chronicles,29,27,Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
1 Chronicles,29,28,"The time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,29,29,"He died at a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor; and Solomon his son reigned in his place."
1 Chronicles,29,30,"Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer,"
1 Chronicles,29,31,ez"with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries."
1 Chronicles,29,32,
2 chronicles ,1,1,"Solomon the son of David was firmly established in his kingdom, and Yahweh"
2 chronicles ,1,2,"his God was with him, and made him exceedingly great."
2 chronicles ,1,3,"Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathers’ households."
2 chronicles ,1,4,"So Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for God’s Tent of Meeting was there, which Yahweh’s servant Moses had made in the wilderness."
2 chronicles ,1,5,But David had brought God’s ark up from Kiriath Jearim to the place that David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.
2 chronicles ,1,6,"Moreover the bronze altar that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made was there before Yahweh’s tabernacle; and Solomon and the assembly were seeking counsel there."
2 chronicles ,1,7,"Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before Yahweh, which was at the Tent of Meeting, and offered one thousand burnt offerings on it."
2 chronicles ,1,8,"That night, God appeared to Solomon and said to him, “Ask for what you want me to give you.”"
2 chronicles ,1,9,"Solomon said to God, “You have shown great loving kindness to David my father, and have made me king in his place."
2 chronicles ,1,10,"Now, Yahweh God, let your promise to David my father be established; for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude."
2 chronicles ,1,11,"Now give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this great people of yours?”"
2 chronicles ,1,12,"God said to Solomon, “Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches, wealth, honor, or the life of those who hate you, nor yet have you asked for long life; but have asked for wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge my people, over whom I have made you king,"
2 chronicles ,1,13,"therefore wisdom and knowledge is granted to you. I will give you riches, wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had who have been before you had, and none after you will have.”"
2 chronicles ,1,14,"So Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the Tent of Meeting, to Jerusalem; and he reigned over Israel."
2 chronicles ,1,15,"Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen. He had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen that he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem."
2 chronicles ,1,16,"The king made silver and gold to be as common as stones in Jerusalem, and he made cedars to be as common as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland."
2 chronicles ,1,17,The horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt and from Kue. The king’s merchants purchased them from Kue.
2 chronicles ,1,18,"They brought up and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred pieces of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty. They also exported them to the Hittite kings and the Syrian kings."
2 chronicles ,1,19,
2 chronicles ,2,1,"Now Solomon decided to build a house for Yahweh’s name, and a house for his kingdom."
2 chronicles ,2,2,"Solomon counted out seventy thousand men to bear burdens, eighty thousand men who were stone cutters in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred to oversee them."
2 chronicles ,2,3,"Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, “As you dealt with David my father, and sent him cedars to build him a house in which to dwell, so deal with me."
2 chronicles ,2,4,"Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of Yahweh my God, to dedicate it to him, to burn before him incense of sweet spices, for the continual show bread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Yahweh our God. This is an ordinance forever to Israel."
2 chronicles ,2,5,“The house which I am building will be great; for our God is greater than all gods.
2 chronicles ,2,6,"But who is able to build him a house, since heaven and the heaven of heavens can’t contain him? Who am I then, that I should build him a house, except just to burn incense before him?"
2 chronicles ,2,7,"“Now therefore send me a man skillful to work in gold, in silver, in brass, in iron, and in purple, crimson, and blue, and who knows how to engrave engravings, to be with the skillful men who are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father provided."
2 chronicles ,2,8,"“Send me also cedar trees, cypress trees, and algum trees out of Lebanon; for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon. Behold, my servants will be with your servants,"
2 chronicles ,2,9,even to prepare me timber in abundance; for the house which I am about to build will be great and wonderful.
2 chronicles ,2,10,"Behold, I will give to your servants, the cutters who cut timber, twenty thousand cors of beaten wheat, twenty thousand baths of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.”"
2 chronicles ,2,11,"Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, “Because Yahweh loves his people, he has made you king over them.”"
2 chronicles ,2,12,"Huram continued, “Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, who has given to David the king a wise son, endowed with discretion and understanding, who would build a house for Yahweh, and a house for his kingdom."
2 chronicles ,2,13,"Now I have sent a skillful man, endowed with understanding, of Huram my father’s,"
2 chronicles ,2,14,"the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan; and his father was a man of Tyre, skillful to work in gold, in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, in timber, and in purple, in blue, in fine linen, and in crimson, also to engrave any kind of engraving and to devise any device; that there may be a place appointed to him with your skillful men, and with the skillful men of my lord David your father."
2 chronicles ,2,15,"“Now therefore the wheat the barley, the oil and the wine, which my lord has spoken of, let him send to his servants;"
2 chronicles ,2,16,"and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as you need. We will bring it to you in floats by sea to Joppa; and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem.”"
2 chronicles ,2,17,"Solomon counted all the foreigners who were in the land of Israel, after the census with which David his father had counted them; and they found one hundred fifty-three thousand six hundred."
2 chronicles ,2,18,"He set seventy thousand of them to bear burdens, eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred overseers to assign the people their work."
2 chronicles ,2,19,
2 chronicles ,3,1,"Then Solomon began to build Yahweh’s house at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where Yahweh appeared to David his father, which he prepared in the place that David had appointed, on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite."
2 chronicles ,3,2,"He began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign."
2 chronicles ,3,3,"Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of God’s house. The length by cubits after the first measure was sixty cubits, and the width twenty cubits."
2 chronicles ,3,4,"The porch that was in front, its length, according to the width of the house, was twenty cubits, and the height one hundred twenty; and he overlaid it within with pure gold."
2 chronicles ,3,5,"He made the larger room with a ceiling of cypress wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and ornamented it with palm trees and chains."
2 chronicles ,3,6,He decorated the house with precious stones for beauty. The gold was gold from Parvaim.
2 chronicles ,3,7,"He also overlaid the house, the beams, the thresholds, its walls, and its doors with gold; and engraved cherubim on the walls."
2 chronicles ,3,8,"He made the most holy place. Its length, according to the width of the house, was twenty cubits, and its width twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents."
2 chronicles ,3,9,The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. He overlaid the upper rooms with gold.
2 chronicles ,3,10,In the most holy place he made two cherubim by carving; and they overlaid them with gold.
2 chronicles ,3,11,"The wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: the wing of the one was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub."
2 chronicles ,3,12,"The wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits, joining to the wing of the other cherub."
2 chronicles ,3,13,"The wings of these cherubim spread themselves out twenty cubits. They stood on their feet, and their faces were toward the house."
2 chronicles ,3,14,"He made the veil of blue, purple, crimson, and fine linen, and ornamented it with cherubim."
2 chronicles ,3,15,"Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty-five cubits height, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits."
2 chronicles ,3,16,"He made chains in the inner sanctuary, and put them on the tops of the pillars; and he made one hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains."
2 chronicles ,3,17,"He set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz."
2 chronicles ,3,18,
2 chronicles ,4,1,"Then he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and ten cubits high."
2 chronicles ,4,2,"Also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim. It was round, five cubits high, and thirty cubits in circumference."
2 chronicles ,4,3,"Under it was the likeness of oxen, which encircled it, for ten cubits, encircling the sea. The oxen were in two rows, cast when it was cast."
2 chronicles ,4,4,"It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set on them above, and all their hindquarters were inward."
2 chronicles ,4,5,"It was a handbreadth thick; and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It received and held three thousand baths."
2 chronicles ,4,6,"He also made ten basins, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them. The things that belonged to the burnt offering were washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in."
2 chronicles ,4,7,"He made the ten lamp stands of gold according to the ordinance concerning them; and he set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left."
2 chronicles ,4,8,"He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. He made one hundred basins of gold."
2 chronicles ,4,9,"Furthermore he made the court of the priests, the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid their doors with brass."
2 chronicles ,4,10,"He set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south."
2 chronicles ,4,11,"Huram made the pots, the shovels, and the basins."
2 chronicles ,4,12,So Huram finished doing the work that he did for king Solomon in God’s house:
2 chronicles ,4,13,"the two pillars, the bowls, the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars, the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars,"
2 chronicles ,4,14,"and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars."
2 chronicles ,4,15,"He also made the bases, and he made the basins on the bases;"
2 chronicles ,4,16,"one sea, and the twelve oxen under it."
2 chronicles ,4,17,"Huram his father also made the pots, the shovels, the forks, and all its vessels for king Solomon, for Yahweh’s house, of bright brass."
2 chronicles ,4,18,"The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah."
2 chronicles ,4,19,Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance; for the weight of the brass could not be determined.
2 chronicles ,4,20,"Solomon made all the vessels that were in God’s house, the golden altar also, and the tables with the show bread on them;"
2 chronicles ,4,21,"and the lamp stands with their lamps, to burn according to the ordinance before the inner sanctuary, of pure gold;"
2 chronicles ,4,22,"and the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs of gold that was perfect gold;"
2 chronicles ,4,23,"and the snuffers, the basins, the spoons, and the fire pans of pure gold. As for the entry of the house, its inner doors for the most holy place and the doors of the main hall of the temple were of gold."
2 chronicles ,4,24,
2 chronicles ,5,1,"Thus all the work that Solomon did for Yahweh’s house was finished. Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, even the silver, the gold, and all the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of God’s house."
2 chronicles ,5,2,"Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers’ households of the children of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Yahweh’s covenant out of David’s city, which is Zion."
2 chronicles ,5,3,"So all the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king at the feast, which was in the seventh month."
2 chronicles ,5,4,All the elders of Israel came. The Levites took up the ark;
2 chronicles ,5,5,"and they brought up the ark, the Tent of Meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; these the priests the Levites brought up."
2 chronicles ,5,6,"King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who were assembled to him, were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and cattle that could not be counted or counted for multitude."
2 chronicles ,5,7,"The priests brought in the ark of Yahweh’s covenant to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim."
2 chronicles ,5,8,"For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its poles above."
2 chronicles ,5,9,The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the ark in front of the inner sanctuary; but they were not seen outside; and it is there to this day.
2 chronicles ,5,10,"There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets which Moses put at Horeb, when Yahweh made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt."
2 chronicles ,5,11,"When the priests had come out of the holy place (for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves, and didn’t keep their divisions;"
2 chronicles ,5,12,"also the Levites who were the singers, all of them, even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and their brothers, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and stringed instruments and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them one hundred twenty priests sounding with trumpets);"
2 chronicles ,5,13,"when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking Yahweh; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised Yahweh, saying,"
2 chronicles ,5,14,“For he is good;
2 chronicles ,5,15,for his loving kindness endures forever!”
2 chronicles ,5,16,"then the house was filled with a cloud, even Yahweh’s house,"
2 chronicles ,5,17,so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for Yahweh’s glory filled God’s house.

2 chronicles ,6,1,"Then Solomon said, “Yahweh has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness."
2 chronicles ,6,2,"But I have built you a house and home, a place for you to dwell in forever.”"
2 chronicles ,6,3,"The king turned his face, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood."
2 chronicles ,6,4,"He said, “Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David my father, and has with his hands fulfilled it, saying,"
2 chronicles ,6,5,"‘Since the day that I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there and I chose no man to be prince over my people Israel;"

2 chronicles ,6,7,"Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel."
2 chronicles ,6,8,"But Yahweh said to David my father, ‘Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart;"

2 chronicles ,6,12,"He stood before Yahweh’s altar in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands"
2 chronicles ,6,13,"(for Solomon had made a bronze scaffold, five cubits long, and five cubits wide, and three cubits high, and had set it in the middle of the court; and he stood on it, and knelt down on his knees before all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands toward heaven)"
2 chronicles ,6,14,"and he said, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven or on earth; you who keep covenant and loving kindness with your servants who walk before you with all their heart;"

2 chronicles ,7,2,"The priests could not enter into Yahweh’s house, because Yahweh’s glory filled Yahweh’s house."
2 chronicles ,7,3,"All the children of Israel looked on, when the fire came down, and Yahweh’s glory was on the house. They bowed themselves with their faces to the ground on the pavement, worshiped, and gave thanks to Yahweh, saying,"
2 chronicles ,7,4,“For he is good;
2 chronicles ,7,5,for his loving kindness endures for ever.”
2 chronicles ,7,6,Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before Yahweh.
2 chronicles ,7,7,King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand head of cattle and a hundred twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated God’s house.
2 chronicles ,7,8,"The priests stood, according to their positions; the Levites also with instruments of music of Yahweh, which David the king had made to give thanks to Yahweh, when David praised by their ministry, saying “For his loving kindness endures for ever.” The priests sounded trumpets before them; and all Israel stood."
2 chronicles ,7,9,"Moreover Solomon made the middle of the court that was before Yahweh’s house holy; for there he offered the burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the fat."
2 chronicles ,7,10,"So Solomon held the feast at that time for seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt."
2 chronicles ,7,11,"On the eighth day, they held a solemn assembly; for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days."

2 chronicles ,8,3,"Solomon went to Hamath Zobah, and prevailed against it."
2 chronicles ,8,4,"He built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the storage cities, which he built in Hamath."

2 chronicles ,8,10,"These were the chief officers of king Solomon, even two-hundred fifty, who ruled over the people."
2 chronicles ,8,11,"Solomon brought up Pharaoh’s daughter out of David’s city to the house that he had built for her; for he said, “My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places where Yahweh’s ark has come are holy.”"
2 chronicles ,8,12,"Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to Yahweh on Yahweh’s altar, which he had built before the porch,"
2 chronicles ,8,13,"even as the duty of every day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, three times per year, during the feast of unleavened bread, during the feast of weeks, and during the feast of tents."
2 chronicles ,8,14,"He appointed, according to the ordinance of David his father, the divisions of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their offices, to praise and to minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required; the doorkeepers also by their divisions at every gate, for David the man of God had so commanded."
2 chronicles ,8,15,"They didn’t depart from the commandment of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures."
2 chronicles ,8,16,Now all the work of Solomon was prepared from the day of the foundation of Yahweh’s house until it was finished. So Yahweh’s house was completed.
2 chronicles ,8,17,"Then Solomon went to Ezion Geber and to Eloth, on the seashore in the land of Edom."
2 chronicles ,8,18,"Huram sent him ships and servants who had knowledge of the sea by the hands of his servants; and they came with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and brought from there four hundred fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon."
2 chronicles ,8,19,
2 chronicles ,9,1,"When the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to test Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great caravan, including camels that bore spices, gold in abundance, and precious stones. When she had come to Solomon, she talked with him about all that was in her heart."
2 chronicles ,9,2,Solomon answered all her questions. There wasn’t anything hidden from Solomon which he didn’t tell her.
2 chronicles ,9,3,"When the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built,"
2 chronicles ,9,4,"the food of his table, the seating of his servants, the attendance of his ministers, their clothing, his cup bearers also, their clothing, and his ascent by which he went up to Yahweh’s house; there was no more spirit in her."
2 chronicles ,9,5,"She said to the king, “It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts and of your wisdom."
2 chronicles ,9,6,"However I didn’t believe their words until I came, and my eyes had seen it; and behold, the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me. You exceed the fame that I heard!"
2 chronicles ,9,7,"Happy are your men, and happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you, and hear your wisdom."
2 chronicles ,9,8,"Blessed be Yahweh your God, who delighted in you, to set you on his throne, to be king for Yahweh your God; because your God loved Israel, to establish them forever. Therefore made he you king over them, to do justice and righteousness.”"
2 chronicles ,9,9,"She gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, spices in great abundance, and precious stones. There was never before such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon."
2 chronicles ,9,10,"The servants of Huram and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, also brought algum trees and precious stones."
2 chronicles ,9,11,"The king used algum tree wood to make terraces for Yahweh’s house and for the king’s house, and harps and stringed instruments for the singers. There were none like these seen before in the land of Judah."
2 chronicles ,9,12,"King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides that which she had brought to the king. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants."
2 chronicles ,9,13,"Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred sixty-six talents of gold,"
2 chronicles ,9,14,besides that which the traders and merchants brought. All the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.
2 chronicles ,9,15,King Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold. Six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one buckler.
2 chronicles ,9,16,He made three hundred shields of beaten gold. Three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield. The king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.
2 chronicles ,9,17,"Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold."
2 chronicles ,9,18,"There were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and armrests on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the armrests."
2 chronicles ,9,19,Twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps. There was nothing like it made in any other kingdom.
2 chronicles ,9,20,"All king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. Silver was not considered valuable in the days of Solomon."
2 chronicles ,9,21,"For the king had ships that went to Tarshish with Huram’s servants. Once every three years, the ships of Tarshish came bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks."
2 chronicles ,9,22,So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
2 chronicles ,9,23,"All the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart."
2 chronicles ,9,24,"They each brought tribute, vessels of silver, vessels of gold, clothing, armor, spices, horses, and mules every year."
2 chronicles ,9,25,"Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he stationed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem."
2 chronicles ,9,26,"He ruled over all the kings from the River even to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt."
2 chronicles ,9,27,"The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars to be as abundant as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland."
2 chronicles ,9,28,They brought horses for Solomon out of Egypt and out of all lands.
2 chronicles ,9,29,"Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, aren’t they written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?"
2 chronicles ,9,30,Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
2 chronicles ,9,31,"Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in his father David’s city: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place."
2 chronicles ,9,32,
2 chronicles ,10,1,Rehoboam went to Shechem; for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.
2 chronicles ,10,2,"When Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon), Jeroboam returned out of Egypt."
2 chronicles ,10,3,"They sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came, and they spoke to Rehoboam, saying,"
2 chronicles ,10,4,"“Your father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make the grievous service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.”"
2 chronicles ,10,5,"He said to them, “Come again to me after three days.”"
2 chronicles ,10,6,So the people departed.
2 chronicles ,10,7,"King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, “What counsel do you give me about how to answer these people?”"
2 chronicles ,10,8,"They spoke to him, saying, “If you are kind to these people, please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.”"
2 chronicles ,10,9,"But he abandoned the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him."
2 chronicles ,10,10,"He said to them, “What counsel do you give, that we may give an answer to these people, who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter?’”"
2 chronicles ,10,11,"The young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, “Thus you shall tell the people who spoke to you, saying, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but make it lighter on us;’ thus you shall say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist."
2 chronicles ,10,12,"Now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.’”"
2 chronicles ,10,13,"So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king asked, saying, “Come to me again the third day.”"
2 chronicles ,10,14,"The king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam abandoned the counsel of the old men,"
2 chronicles ,10,15,"and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.”"
2 chronicles ,10,16,"So the king didn’t listen to the people; for it was brought about by God, that Yahweh might establish his word, which he spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat."
2 chronicles ,10,17,"When all Israel saw that the king didn’t listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, “What portion have we in David? We don’t have an inheritance in the son of Jesse! Every man to your tents, Israel! Now see to your own house, David.” So all Israel departed to their tents."
2 chronicles ,10,18,"But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them."
2 chronicles ,10,19,"Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the men subject to forced labor; and the children of Israel stoned him to death with stones. King Rehoboam hurried to get himself up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem."
2 chronicles ,10,20,So Israel rebelled against David’s house to this day.
2 chronicles ,10,21,
2 chronicles ,11,1,"When Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, one hundred eighty thousand chosen men who were warriors, to fight against Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam."
2 chronicles ,11,2,"But Yahweh’s word came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,"
2 chronicles ,11,3,"“Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,"
2 chronicles ,11,4,"‘Yahweh says, “You shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers! Every man return to his house; for this thing is of me.”’” So they listened to Yahweh’s words, and returned from going against Jeroboam."
2 chronicles ,11,5,"Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah."
2 chronicles ,11,6,"He built Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,"
2 chronicles ,11,7,"Beth Zur, Soco, Adullam,"
2 chronicles ,11,8,"Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,"
2 chronicles ,11,9,"Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,"
2 chronicles ,11,10,"Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, which are fortified cities in Judah and in Benjamin."
2 chronicles ,11,11,"He fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of food, oil and wine."
2 chronicles ,11,12,"He put shields and spears in every city, and made them exceedingly strong. Judah and Benjamin belonged to him."
2 chronicles ,11,13,The priests and the Levites who were in all Israel stood with him out of all their territory.
2 chronicles ,11,14,"For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem; for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priest’s office to Yahweh."
2 chronicles ,11,15,"He himself appointed priests for the high places, for the male goats, and for the calves which he had made."
2 chronicles ,11,16,"After them, out of all the tribes of Israel, those who set their hearts to seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Yahweh, the God of their fathers."
2 chronicles ,11,17,"So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong for three years; for they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon."
2 chronicles ,11,18,"Rehoboam took a wife for himself, Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse."
2 chronicles ,11,19,"She bore him sons: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham."
2 chronicles ,11,20,"After her, he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom; and she bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith."
2 chronicles ,11,21,"Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines; for he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and became the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters."
2 chronicles ,11,22,"Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief, the prince among his brothers; for he intended to make him king."
2 chronicles ,11,23,"He dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city. He gave them food in abundance and he sought many wives for them."
2 chronicles ,11,24,
2 chronicles ,12,1,"When the kingdom of Rehoboam was established and he was strong, he abandoned Yahweh’s law, and all Israel with him."
2 chronicles ,12,2,"In the fifth year of king Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had trespassed against Yahweh,"
2 chronicles ,12,3,"with twelve hundred chariots, and sixty thousand horsemen. The people were without number who came with him out of Egypt: the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians."
2 chronicles ,12,4,"He took the fortified cities which belonged to Judah, and came to Jerusalem."
2 chronicles ,12,5,"Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, who were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, “Yahweh says, ‘You have forsaken me, therefore I have also left you in the hand of Shishak.’”"
2 chronicles ,12,6,"Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, “Yahweh is righteous.”"
2 chronicles ,12,7,"When Yahweh saw that they humbled themselves, Yahweh’s word came to Shemaiah, saying, “They have humbled themselves. I will not destroy them; but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath won’t be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak."
2 chronicles ,12,8,"Nevertheless they will be his servants, that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.”"
2 chronicles ,12,9,So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem and took away the treasures of Yahweh’s house and the treasures of the king’s house. He took it all away. He also took away the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
2 chronicles ,12,10,"King Rehoboam made shields of brass in their place, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who kept the door of the king’s house."
2 chronicles ,12,11,"As often as the king entered into Yahweh’s house, the guard came and bore them, then brought them back into the guard room."
2 chronicles ,12,12,"When he humbled himself, Yahweh’s wrath turned from him, so as not to destroy him altogether. Moreover, there were good things found in Judah."
2 chronicles ,12,13,"So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned; for Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Yahweh had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there. His mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess."
2 chronicles ,12,14,"He did that which was evil, because he didn’t set his heart to seek Yahweh."
2 chronicles ,12,15,"Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, aren’t they written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, in the genealogies? There were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually."
2 chronicles ,12,16,"Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in David’s city; and Abijah his son reigned in his place."
2 chronicles ,12,17,
2 chronicles ,13,1,"In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam, Abijah began to reign over Judah."
2 chronicles ,13,2,He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
2 chronicles ,13,3,"Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men; and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valor."
2 chronicles ,13,4,"Abijah stood up on Mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, “Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel:"
2 chronicles ,13,5,"Ought you not to know that Yahweh, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?"
2 chronicles ,13,6,"Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord."
2 chronicles ,13,7,"Worthless men were gathered to him, wicked fellows who strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender hearted, and could not withstand them."
2 chronicles ,13,8,"“Now you intend to withstand the kingdom of Yahweh in the hand of the sons of David. You are a great multitude, and the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods are with you."
2 chronicles ,13,9,"Haven’t you driven out the priests of Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made priests for yourselves according to the ways of the peoples of other lands? Whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may be a priest of those who are no gods."
2 chronicles ,13,10,"“But as for us, Yahweh is our God, and we have not forsaken him. We have priests serving Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work;"
2 chronicles ,13,11,"and they burn to Yahweh every morning and every evening burnt offerings and sweet incense. They also set the show bread in order on the pure table; and the lamp stand of gold with its lamps, to burn every evening; for we keep the instruction of Yahweh our God, but you have forsaken him."
2 chronicles ,13,12,"Behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. Children of Israel, don’t fight against Yahweh, the God of your fathers; for you will not prosper.”"
2 chronicles ,13,13,"But Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them; so they were before Judah, and the ambush was behind them."
2 chronicles ,13,14,"When Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried to Yahweh, and the priests sounded with the trumpets."
2 chronicles ,13,15,"Then the men of Judah gave a shout. As the men of Judah shouted, God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah."
2 chronicles ,13,16,"The children of Israel fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hand."
2 chronicles ,13,17,"Abijah and his people killed them with a great slaughter, so five hundred thousand chosen men of Israel fell down slain."
2 chronicles ,13,18,"Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied on Yahweh, the God of their fathers."
2 chronicles ,13,19,"Abijah pursued Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with its villages, Jeshanah with its villages, and Ephron with its villages."
2 chronicles ,13,20,"Jeroboam didn’t recover strength again in the days of Abijah. Yahweh struck him, and he died."
2 chronicles ,13,21,"But Abijah grew mighty, and took for himself fourteen wives, and became the father of twenty-two sons, and sixteen daughters."
2 chronicles ,13,22,"The rest of the acts of Abijah, his ways, and his sayings are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo."
2 chronicles ,13,23,
2 chronicles ,14,1,"So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in David’s city; and Asa his son reigned in his place. In his days, the land was quiet ten years."
2 chronicles ,14,2,Asa did that which was good and right in Yahweh his God’s eyes;
2 chronicles ,14,3,"for he took away the foreign altars and the high places, broke down the pillars, cut down the Asherah poles,"
2 chronicles ,14,4,"and commanded Judah to seek Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and to obey his law and command."
2 chronicles ,14,5,Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun images; and the kingdom was quiet before him.
2 chronicles ,14,6,"He built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because Yahweh had given him rest."
2 chronicles ,14,7,"For he said to Judah, “Let us build these cities, and make walls around them, with towers, gates, and bars. The land is yet before us, because we have sought Yahweh our God. We have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side.” So they built and prospered."
2 chronicles ,14,8,"Asa had an army of three hundred thousand out of Judah who bore bucklers and spears, and two hundred eighty thousand out of Benjamin who bore shields and drew bows. All these were mighty men of valor."
2 chronicles ,14,9,"Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million troops and three hundred chariots, and he came to Mareshah."
2 chronicles ,14,10,"Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah."
2 chronicles ,14,11,"Asa cried to Yahweh his God, and said, “Yahweh, there is no one besides you to help, between the mighty and him who has no strength. Help us, Yahweh our God; for we rely on you, and in your name are we come against this multitude. Yahweh, you are our God. Don’t let man prevail against you.”"
2 chronicles ,14,12,So Yahweh struck the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.
2 chronicles ,14,13,Asa and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar: and so many of the Ethiopians fell that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before Yahweh and before his army; and they carried away very much booty.
2 chronicles ,14,14,"They struck all the cities around Gerar; for the fear of Yahweh came on them, and they plundered all the cities; for there was much plunder in them."
2 chronicles ,14,15,"They also struck the tents of livestock, and carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned to Jerusalem."
2 chronicles ,14,16,
2 chronicles ,15,1,The Spirit of God came on Azariah the son of Oded:
2 chronicles ,15,2,"and he went out to meet Asa, and said to him, “Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin! Yahweh is with you, while you are with him; and if you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will forsake you."
2 chronicles ,15,3,"Now for a long time Israel was without the true God, without a teaching priest, and without law."
2 chronicles ,15,4,"But when in their distress they turned to Yahweh, the God of Israel, and sought him, he was found by them."
2 chronicles ,15,5,"In those times there was no peace to him who went out, nor to him who came in; but great troubles were on all the inhabitants of the lands."
2 chronicles ,15,6,"They were broken in pieces, nation against nation, and city against city; for God troubled them with all adversity."
2 chronicles ,15,7,"But you be strong, and don’t let your hands be slack; for your work will be rewarded.”"
2 chronicles ,15,8,"When Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from the hill country of Ephraim; and he renewed Yahweh’s altar that was before Yahweh’s porch."
2 chronicles ,15,9,"He gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those who lived with them out of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon; for they came to him out of Israel in abundance when they saw that Yahweh his God was with him."
2 chronicles ,15,10,"So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of Asa’s reign."
2 chronicles ,15,11,"They sacrificed to Yahweh in that day, of the plunder which they had brought, seven hundred head of cattle and seven thousand sheep."
2 chronicles ,15,12,"They entered into the covenant to seek Yahweh, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul;"
2 chronicles ,15,13,"and that whoever would not seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman."
2 chronicles ,15,14,"They swore to Yahweh with a loud voice, with shouting, with trumpets, and with cornets."
2 chronicles ,15,15,"All Judah rejoiced at the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found by them. Then Yahweh gave them rest all around."
2 chronicles ,15,16,"Also Maacah, the mother of Asa the king, he removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; so Asa cut down her image, ground it into dust, and burned it at the brook Kidron."
2 chronicles ,15,17,But the high places were not taken away out of Israel; nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.
2 chronicles ,15,18,"He brought the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, gold, and vessels into God’s house."
2 chronicles ,15,19,There was no more war to the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign.
2 chronicles ,15,20,
2 chronicles ,16,1,"In the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s reign, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah."
2 chronicles ,16,2,"Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of Yahweh’s house and of the king’s house, and sent to Ben Hadad king of Syria, who lived at Damascus, saying,"
2 chronicles ,16,3,"“Let there be a treaty between me and you, as there was between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent you silver and gold. Go, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.”"
2 chronicles ,16,4,"Ben Hadad listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they struck Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali."

2 chronicles ,16,6,"Then Asa the king took all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Rama, and its timber, with which Baasha had built; and he built Geba and Mizpah with them."
2 chronicles ,16,7,"At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, “Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and have not relied on Yahweh your God, therefore the army of the king of Syria has escaped out of your hand."
2 chronicles ,16,8,"Weren’t the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge army, with chariots and horsemen exceeding many? Yet, because you relied on Yahweh, he delivered them into your hand."
2 chronicles ,16,9,"For Yahweh’s eyes run back and forth throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. You have done foolishly in this; for from now on you will have wars.”"
2 chronicles ,16,10,"Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in the prison; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time."

2 chronicles ,17,3,"Yahweh was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and didn’t seek the Baals,"
2 chronicles ,17,4,"but sought to the God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not in the ways of Israel."
2 chronicles ,17,5,"Therefore Yahweh established the kingdom in his hand. All Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he had riches and honor in abundance."
2 chronicles ,17,6,"His heart was lifted up in the ways of Yahweh. Furthermore, he took away the high places and the Asherah poles out of Judah."

Ezra,2,72,
Ezra,3,1,"When the seventh month had come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem."
Ezra,3,2,"Then Jeshua the son of Jozadak stood up with his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his brothers, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings on it, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God."
Ezra,3,3,"In spite of their fear because of the peoples of the surrounding lands, they set the altar on its base; and they offered burnt offerings on it to Yahweh, even burnt offerings morning and evening."
Ezra,3,4,"They kept the feast of tents, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the ordinance, as the duty of every day required;"
Ezra,3,5,"and afterward the continual burnt offering, the offerings of the new moons, of all the set feasts of Yahweh that were consecrated, and of everyone who willingly offered a freewill offering to Yahweh."
Ezra,3,6,"From the first day of the seventh month, they began to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh; but the foundation of Yahweh’s temple was not yet laid."
Ezra,3,7,"They also gave money to the masons, and to the carpenters. They also gave food, drink, and oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea, to Joppa, according to the grant that they had from Cyrus King of Persia."
Ezra,3,8,"Now in the second year of their coming to God’s house at Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brothers the priests and the Levites, and all those who had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem, began the work and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to have the oversight of the work of Yahweh’s house."
Ezra,3,9,"Then Jeshua stood with his sons and his brothers, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to have the oversight of the workmen in God’s house: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brothers the Levites."
Ezra,3,10,"When the builders laid the foundation of Yahweh’s temple, they set the priests in their clothing with trumpets, with the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise Yahweh, according to the directions of David king of Israel."
Ezra,3,11,"They sang to one another in praising and giving thanks to Yahweh, “For he is good, for his loving kindness endures forever toward Israel.” All the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised Yahweh, because the foundation of Yahweh’s house had been laid."
Ezra,3,12,"But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers’ households, the old men who had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice. Many also shouted aloud for joy,"
Ezra,3,13,"so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people; for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard far away."
Ezra,3,14,
Ezra,4,1,"Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building a temple to Yahweh, the God of Israel;"
Ezra,4,2,"they came near to Zerubbabel, and to the heads of fathers’ households, and said to them, “Let us build with you; for we seek your God, as you do; and we have been sacrificing to him since the days of Esar Haddon king of Assyria, who brought us up here.”"
Ezra,4,3,"But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of fathers’ households of Israel, said to them, “You have nothing to do with us in building a house to our God; but we ourselves together will build to Yahweh, the God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.”"
Ezra,4,4,"Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building."
Ezra,4,5,"They hired counselors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia."
Ezra,4,6,"In the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem."
Ezra,4,7,"In the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his companions, wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in Syrian, and delivered in the Syrian language."
Ezra,4,8,"Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king as follows,"
Ezra,4,9,"then Rehum the chancellor, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions, the Dinaites, and the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Shushanchites, the Dehaites, the Elamites,"
Ezra,4,10,"and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar brought over, and set in the city of Samaria, and in the rest of the country beyond the River, and so forth, wrote."
Ezra,4,11,This is the copy of the letter that they sent:
Ezra,4,12,"To King Artaxerxes,"
Ezra,4,13,From your servants the men beyond the River.
Ezra,4,14,"Be it known to the king that the Jews who came up from you have come to us to Jerusalem. They are building the rebellious and bad city, and have finished the walls, and repaired the foundations."
Ezra,4,15,"Be it known now to the king that if this city is built and the walls finished, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and in the end it will be hurtful to the kings."
Ezra,4,16,"Now because we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not appropriate for us to see the king’s dishonor, therefore we have sent and informed the king,"
Ezra,4,17,"that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers. You will see in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful to kings and provinces, and that they have started rebellions within it in the past. That is why this city was destroyed."
Ezra,4,18,"We inform the king that, if this city is built and the walls finished, then you will have no possession beyond the River."
Ezra,4,19,"Then the king sent an answer to Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions who live in Samaria, and in the rest of the country beyond the River:"
Ezra,4,20,Peace.
Ezra,4,21,The letter which you sent to us has been plainly read before me.
Ezra,4,22,"I decreed, and search has been made, and it was found that this city has made insurrection against kings in the past, and that rebellion and revolts have been made in it."
Ezra,4,23,"There have also been mighty kings over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all the country beyond the River; and tribute, custom, and toll, was paid to them."
Ezra,4,24,"Make a decree now to cause these men to cease, and that this city not be built, until a decree is made by me."
Ezra,4,25,Be careful that you not be slack doing so. Why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?
Ezra,4,26,"Then when the copy of king Artaxerxes’ letter was read before Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews, and made them to cease by force of arms."
Ezra,4,27,Then work stopped on God’s house which is at Jerusalem. It stopped until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
Ezra,4,28,
Ezra,5,1,"Now the prophets, Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem. They prophesied to them in the name of the God of Israel."
Ezra,5,2,"Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak rose up and began to build God’s house which is at Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God, helping them."
Ezra,5,3,"At the same time Tattenai, the governor beyond the River came to them, with Shetharbozenai, and their companions, and asked them, “Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?”"
Ezra,5,4,They also asked for the names of the men were who were making this building.
Ezra,5,5,"But the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, and they did not make them cease, until the matter should come to Darius, and an answer should be returned by letter concerning it."
Ezra,5,6,"The copy of the letter that Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shetharbozenai, and his companions the Apharsachites, who were beyond the River, sent to Darius the king follows."
Ezra,5,7,"They sent a letter to him, in which was written:"
Ezra,5,8,"To Darius the king, all peace."
Ezra,5,9,"Be it known to the king that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is built with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls. This work goes on with diligence and prospers in their hands."
Ezra,5,10,"Then we asked those elders, and said to them thus, “Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?”"
Ezra,5,11,"We asked them their names also, to inform you that we might write the names of the men who were at their head."
Ezra,5,12,"Thus they returned us answer, saying, “We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and are building the house that was built these many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished."
Ezra,5,13,"But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon."
Ezra,5,14,"But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of God."
Ezra,5,15,"The gold and silver vessels of God’s house, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought into the temple of Babylon, those Cyrus the king also took out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor."
Ezra,5,16,"He said to him, ‘Take these vessels, go, put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let God’s house be built in its place.’"
Ezra,5,17,"Then the same Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of God’s house which is in Jerusalem. Since that time even until now has it been in building, and yet it is not completed."
Ezra,5,18,"Now therefore, if it seems good to the king, let a search be made in the king’s treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it is so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem; and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.”"
Ezra,5,19,
Ezra,6,1,"Then Darius the king made a decree, and the house of the archives, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon, was searched."
Ezra,6,2,"A scroll was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of Media, and in it this was written for a record:"
Ezra,6,3,"In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king made a decree: Concerning God’s house at Jerusalem, let the house be built, the place where they offer sacrifices, and let its foundations be strongly laid; with its height sixty cubits, and its width sixty cubits;"
Ezra,6,4,with three courses of great stones and a course of new timber. Let the expenses be given out of the king’s house.
Ezra,6,5,"Also let the gold and silver vessels of God’s house, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought to Babylon, be restored and brought again to the temple which is at Jerusalem, everything to its place. You shall put them in God’s house."
Ezra,6,6,"Now therefore, Tattenai, governor beyond the River, Shetharbozenai, and your companions the Apharsachites, who are beyond the River, you must stay far from there."
Ezra,6,7,Leave the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place.
Ezra,6,8,"Moreover I make a decree what you shall do for these elders of the Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king’s goods, even of the tribute beyond the River, expenses must be given with all diligence to these men, that they not be hindered."
Ezra,6,9,"That which they have need of, including young bulls, rams, and lambs, for burnt offerings to the God of heaven; also wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the word of the priests who are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail;"
Ezra,6,10,"that they may offer sacrifices of pleasant aroma to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons."
Ezra,6,11,"I have also made a decree that whoever alters this message, let a beam be pulled out from his house, and let him be lifted up and fastened on it; and let his house be made a dunghill for this."
Ezra,6,12,"May the God who has caused his name to dwell there overthrow all kings and peoples who stretch out their hand to alter the same, to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree. Let it be done with all diligence."
Ezra,6,13,"Then Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, Shetharbozenai, and their companions did accordingly with all diligence, because Darius the king had sent a decree."
Ezra,6,14,"The elders of the Jews built and prospered, through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. They built and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the decree of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia."
Ezra,6,15,"This house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king."
Ezra,6,16,"The children of Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy."
Ezra,6,17,"They offered at the dedication of this house of God one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve male goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel."
Ezra,6,18,"They set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses."
Ezra,6,19,The children of the captivity kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.
Ezra,6,20,"Because the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together, all of them were pure. They killed the Passover for all the children of the captivity, for their brothers the priests, and for themselves."
Ezra,6,21,"The children of Israel who had returned out of the captivity, and all who had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the nations of the land, to seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, ate,"
Ezra,6,22,"and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy; because Yahweh had made them joyful, and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, to strengthen their hands in the work of God, the God of Israel’s house."
Ezra,6,23,
Ezra,7,1,"Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,"
Ezra,7,2,"the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,"
Ezra,7,3,"the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,"
Ezra,7,4,"the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,"
Ezra,7,5,"the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest—"
Ezra,7,6,"this Ezra went up from Babylon. He was a skilled scribe in the law of Moses, which Yahweh, the God of Israel, had given; and the king granted him all his request, according to Yahweh his God’s hand on him."
Ezra,7,7,"Some of the children of Israel, including some of the priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants went up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king."
Ezra,7,8,"He came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king."
Ezra,7,9,"For on the first day of the first month he began to go up from Babylon; and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God on him."
Ezra,7,10,"For Ezra had set his heart to seek Yahweh’s law, and to do it, and to teach statutes and ordinances in Israel."
Ezra,7,11,"Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, even the scribe of the words of Yahweh’s commandments, and of his statutes to Israel:"
Ezra,7,12,"Artaxerxes, king of kings,"
Ezra,7,13,"To Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the perfect God of heaven."
Ezra,7,14,Now
Ezra,7,15,"I make a decree, that all those of the people of Israel, and their priests and the Levites, in my realm, who intend of their own free will to go to Jerusalem, go with you."
Ezra,7,16,"Because you are sent by the king and his seven counselors, to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of your God which is in your hand,"
Ezra,7,17,"and to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem,"
Ezra,7,18,"and all the silver and gold that you will find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem;"
Ezra,7,19,"therefore you shall with all diligence buy with this money bulls, rams, lambs, with their meal offerings and their drink offerings, and shall offer them on the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem."
Ezra,7,20,"Whatever seems good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, do that according to the will of your God."
Ezra,7,21,"The vessels that are given to you for the service of the house of your God, deliver before the God of Jerusalem."
Ezra,7,22,"Whatever more will be needed for the house of your God, which you may have occasion to give, give it out of the king’s treasure house."
Ezra,7,23,"I, even I Artaxerxes the king, make a decree to all the treasurers who are beyond the River, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, requires of you, it shall be done with all diligence,"
Ezra,7,24,"up to one hundred talents of silver, and to one hundred cors of wheat, and to one hundred baths of wine, and to one hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much."
Ezra,7,25,"Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?"
Ezra,7,26,"Also we inform you that it shall not be lawful to impose tribute, custom, or toll, on any of the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, temple servants, or laborers of this house of God."
Ezra,7,27,"You, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God that is in your hand, appoint magistrates and judges, who may judge all the people who are beyond the River, who all know the laws of your God; and teach him who doesn’t know them."
Ezra,7,28,"Whoever will not do the law of your God and the law of the king, let judgment be executed on him with all diligence, whether it is to death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment."
Ezra,7,29,"Blessed be Yahweh, the God of our fathers, who has put such a thing as this in the king’s heart, to beautify Yahweh’s house which is in Jerusalem;"
Ezra,7,30,"and has extended loving kindness to me before the king and his counselors, and before all the king’s mighty princes. I was strengthened according to Yahweh my God’s hand on me, and I gathered together chief men out of Israel to go up with me."
Ezra,7,31,
Ezra,8,1,"Now these are the heads of their fathers’ households, and this is the genealogy of those who went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king:"
Ezra,8,2,"Of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom."
Ezra,8,3,"Of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel."
Ezra,8,4,"Of the sons of David, Hattush."
Ezra,8,5,"Of the sons of Shecaniah, of the sons of Parosh, Zechariah; and with him were listed by genealogy of the males one hundred fifty."
Ezra,8,6,"Of the sons of Pahathmoab, Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah; and with him two hundred males."
Ezra,8,7,"Of the sons of Shecaniah, the son of Jahaziel; and with him three hundred males."
Ezra,8,8,"Of the sons of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan; and with him fifty males."
Ezra,8,9,"Of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah; and with him seventy males."
Ezra,8,10,"Of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael; and with him eighty males."
Ezra,8,11,"Of the sons of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel; and with him two hundred eighteen males."
Ezra,8,12,"Of the sons of Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah; and with him one hundred sixty males."
Ezra,8,13,"Of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah the son of Bebai; and with him twenty-eight males."
Ezra,8,14,"Of the sons of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan; and with him one hundred ten males."
Ezra,8,15,"Of the sons of Adonikam, who were the last; and these are their names: Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah; and with them sixty males."
Ezra,8,16,"Of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud; and with them seventy males."
Ezra,8,17,"I gathered them together to the river that runs to Ahava; and there we encamped three days: and I looked around at the people the priests, and found there were none of the sons of Levi."
Ezra,8,18,"Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, for Elnathan, for Jarib, for Elnathan, for Nathan, for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib and for Elnathan, who were teachers."
Ezra,8,19,"I sent them out to Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia; and I told them what they should tell Iddo, and his brothers the temple servants, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring to us ministers for the house of our God."
Ezra,8,20,"According to the good hand of our God on us they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brothers, eighteen;"
Ezra,8,21,"and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brothers and their sons, twenty;"
Ezra,8,22,"and of the temple servants, whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites, two hundred twenty temple servants. All of them were mentioned by name."
Ezra,8,23,"Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek from him a straight way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our possessions."
Ezra,8,24,"For I was ashamed to ask of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy on the way, because we had spoken to the king, saying, “The hand of our God is on all those who seek him, for good; but his power and his wrath is against all those who forsake him.”"
Ezra,8,25,So we fasted and begged our God for this: and he granted our request.
Ezra,8,26,"Then I set apart twelve of the chiefs of the priests, even Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers with them,"
Ezra,8,27,"and weighed to them the silver, the gold, and the vessels, even the offering for the house of our God, which the king, his counselors, his princes, and all Israel there present, had offered."
Ezra,8,28,"I weighed into their hand six hundred fifty talents of silver, one hundred talents of silver vessels; one hundred talents of gold,"
Ezra,8,29,"twenty bowls of gold weighing one thousand darics; and two vessels of fine bright brass, precious as gold."
Ezra,8,30,"I said to them, “You are holy to Yahweh, and the vessels are holy. The silver and the gold are a freewill offering to Yahweh, the God of your fathers."
Ezra,8,31,"Watch and keep them, until you weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the princes of the fathers’ households of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the rooms of Yahweh’s house.”"
Ezra,8,32,"So the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God."
Ezra,8,33,"Then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was on us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and the bandit by the way."
Ezra,8,34,"We came to Jerusalem, and stayed there three days."
Ezra,8,35,"On the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, the Levite;"
Ezra,8,36,everything by number and by weight; and all the weight was written at that time.
Ezra,8,37,"The children of the captivity, who had come out of exile, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve male goats for a sin offering. All this was a burnt offering to Yahweh."
Ezra,8,38,"They delivered the king’s commissions to the king’s satraps, and to the governors beyond the River. So they supported the people and God’s house."
Ezra,8,39,
Ezra,9,1,"Now when these things were done, the princes came near to me, saying, “The people of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, following their abominations, even those of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites."
Ezra,9,2,"For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy offspring have mixed themselves with the peoples of the lands. Yes, the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this trespass.”"
Ezra,9,3,"When I heard this thing, I tore my garment and my robe, and pulled the hair out of my head and of my beard, and sat down confounded."
Ezra,9,4,"Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel were assembled to me, because of their trespass of the captivity; and I sat confounded until the evening offering."
Ezra,9,5,"At the evening offering I arose up from my humiliation, even with my garment and my robe torn; and I fell on my knees, and spread out my hands to Yahweh my God;"
Ezra,9,6,"and I said, “My God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to you, my God; for our iniquities have increased over our head, and our guiltiness has grown up to the heavens."
Ezra,9,7,"Since the days of our fathers we have been exceeding guilty to this day; and for our iniquities we, our kings, and our priests, have been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to plunder, and to confusion of face, as it is this day."
Ezra,9,8,"Now for a little moment grace has been shown from Yahweh our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and revived us a little in our bondage."
Ezra,9,9,"For we are bondservants; yet our God has not forsaken us in our bondage, but has extended loving kindness to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to revive us, to set up the house of our God, and to repair its ruins, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem."
Ezra,9,10,"“Now, our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken your commandments,"
Ezra,9,11,"which you have commanded by your servants the prophets, saying, ‘The land, to which you go to possess it, is an unclean land through the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, through their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their filthiness."
Ezra,9,12,"Now therefore don’t give your daughters to their sons. Don’t take their daughters to your sons, nor seek their peace or their prosperity forever; that you may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children forever.’"
Ezra,9,13,"“After all that has come on us for our evil deeds, and for our great guilt, since you, our God, have punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and have given us such a remnant,"
Ezra,9,14,"shall we again break your commandments, and join in affinity with the peoples that do these abominations? Wouldn’t you be angry with us until you had consumed us, so that there would be no remnant, nor any to escape?"
Ezra,9,15,"Yahweh, the God of Israel, you are righteous; for we are left a remnant that has escaped, as it is today. Behold, we are before you in our guiltiness; for no one can stand before you because of this.”"
Ezra,9,16,
Ezra,10,1,"Now while Ezra prayed and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before God’s house, there was gathered together to him out of Israel a very great assembly of men and women and children; for the people wept very bitterly."
Ezra,10,2,"Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered Ezra, “We have trespassed against our God, and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land. Yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing."
Ezra,10,3,"Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and those who as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God. Let it be done according to the law."
Ezra,10,4,"Arise; for the matter belongs to you, and we are with you. Be courageous, and do it.”"
Ezra,10,5,"Then Ezra arose, and made the chiefs of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word. So they swore."
Ezra,10,6,"Then Ezra rose up from before God’s house, and went into the room of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib. When he came there, he ate no bread, nor drank water; for he mourned because of their trespass of the captivity."
Ezra,10,7,"They made a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together to Jerusalem;"
Ezra,10,8,"and that whoever didn’t come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his possessions should be forfeited, and himself separated from the assembly of the captivity."
Ezra,10,9,"Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together to Jerusalem within the three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the wide place in front of God’s house, trembling because of this matter, and because of the great rain."
Ezra,10,10,"Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have trespassed, and have married foreign women, to increase the guilt of Israel."
Ezra,10,11,"Now therefore make confession to Yahweh, the God of your fathers, and do his pleasure; and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the foreign women.”"
Ezra,10,12,"Then all the assembly answered with a loud voice, “As you have said concerning us, so must we do."
Ezra,10,13,"But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand outside. This is not a work of one day or two, for we have greatly transgressed in this matter."
Ezra,10,14,"Now let our princes be appointed for all the assembly, and let all those who are in our cities who have married foreign women come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and its judges, until the fierce wrath of our God is turned from us, until this matter is resolved.”"
Ezra,10,15,Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this; and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.
Ezra,10,16,"The children of the captivity did so. Ezra the priest, with certain heads of fathers’ households, after their fathers’ houses, and all of them by their names, were set apart; and they sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter."
Ezra,10,17,They finished with all the men who had married foreign women by the first day of the first month.
Ezra,10,18,Among the sons of the priests there were found who had married foreign women:
Ezra,10,19,"of the sons of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and his brothers, Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah."
Ezra,10,20,"They gave their hand that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their guilt."

Ezra,10,45,All these had taken foreign wives; and some of them had wives by whom they had children.
Ezra,10,46,
Ezra,1,1,"Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that Yahweh’s word"
Ezra,1,2,"by Jeremiah’s mouth might be accomplished, Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,"
Ezra,1,3,"“Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, ‘Yahweh, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he has commanded me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah."
Ezra,1,4,"Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of Yahweh, the God of Israel (he is God), which is in Jerusalem."
Ezra,1,5,"Whoever is left, in any place where he lives, let the men of his place help him with silver, with gold, with goods, and with animals, besides the freewill offering for God’s house which is in Jerusalem.’”"
Ezra,1,6,"Then the heads of fathers’ households of Judah and Benjamin, the priests, and the Levites, all whose spirit God had stirred to go up rose up to build Yahweh’s house which is in Jerusalem."
Ezra,1,7,"All those who were around them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, with animals, and with precious things, besides all that was willingly offered."
Ezra,1,8,"Also Cyrus the king brought out the vessels of Yahweh’s house, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought out of Jerusalem, and had put in the house of his gods;"
Ezra,1,9,"even those, Cyrus king of Persia brought out by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and counted them out to Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah."
Ezra,1,10,"This is the number of them: thirty platters of gold, one thousand platters of silver, twenty-nine knives,"
Ezra,1,11,"thirty bowls of gold, four hundred ten silver bowls of a second sort, and one thousand other vessels."
Ezra,1,12,All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand four hundred. Sheshbazzar brought all these up when the captives were brought up from Babylon to Jerusalem.
Ezra,1,13,

Nehemiah,1,1,The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah.
Nehemiah,1,2,"Now in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,"
Nehemiah,1,3,"Hanani, one of my brothers, came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I asked them about the Jews who had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem."
Nehemiah,1,4,"They said to me, “The remnant who are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem is also broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.”"
Nehemiah,1,5,"When I heard these words, I sat down and wept, and mourned several days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven,"
Nehemiah,1,6,"and said, “I beg you, Yahweh, the God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments:"
Nehemiah,1,7,"Let your ear now be attentive, and your eyes open, that you may listen to the prayer of your servant, which I pray before you at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel your servants, while I confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against you. Yes, I and my father’s house have sinned."
Nehemiah,1,8,"We have dealt very corruptly against you, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which you commanded your servant Moses."
Nehemiah,1,9,"“Remember, I beg you, the word that you commanded your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you trespass, I will scatter you among the peoples;"
Nehemiah,1,10,"but if you return to me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens, yet I will gather them from there, and will bring them to the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to dwell there.’"
Nehemiah,1,11,"“Now these are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power, and by your strong hand."
Nehemiah,1,12,"Lord, I beg you, let your ear be attentive now to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants, who delight to fear your name; and please prosper your servant today, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.”"
Nehemiah,1,13,Now I was cup bearer to the king.
Nehemiah,1,14,
Nehemiah,2,1,"In the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him, I picked up the wine, and gave it to the king. Now I had not been sad before in his presence."
Nehemiah,2,2,"The king said to me, “Why is your face sad, since you are not sick? This is nothing else but sorrow of heart.”"
Nehemiah,2,3,Then I was very much afraid.
Nehemiah,2,4,"I said to the king, “Let the king live forever! Why shouldn’t my face be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ tombs, lies waste, and its gates have been consumed with fire?”"
Nehemiah,2,5,"Then the king said to me, “What is your request?”"
Nehemiah,2,6,So I prayed to the God of heaven.
Nehemiah,2,7,"I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, that you would send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers’ tombs, that I may build it.”"
Nehemiah,2,8,"The king said to me (the queen was also sitting by him), “How long will your journey be? When will you return?”"
Nehemiah,2,9,"So it pleased the king to send me, and I set a time for him."
Nehemiah,2,10,"Moreover I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River, that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah;"
Nehemiah,2,11,"and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple, for the wall of the city, and for the house that I will occupy.”"
Nehemiah,2,12,"The king granted my requests, because of the good hand of my God on me."
Nehemiah,2,13,"Then I came to the governors beyond the River, and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me."
Nehemiah,2,14,"When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly, because a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel."
Nehemiah,2,15,"So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days."
Nehemiah,2,16,"I arose in the night, I and a few men with me. I didn’t tell anyone what my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem. There wasn’t any animal with me, except the animal that I rode on."
Nehemiah,2,17,"I went out by night by the valley gate, even toward the jackal’s well, then to the dung gate, and inspected the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and its gates were consumed with fire."
Nehemiah,2,18,"Then I went on to the spring gate and to the king’s pool, but there was no place for the animal that was under me to pass."
Nehemiah,2,19,"Then went I up in the night by the brook, and inspected the wall; and I turned back, and entered by the valley gate, and so returned."
Nehemiah,2,20,"The rulers didn’t know where I went, or what I did. I had not as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest who did the work."
Nehemiah,2,21,"Then I said to them, “You see the bad situation that we are in, how Jerusalem lies waste, and its gates are burned with fire. Come, let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we won’t be disgraced.”"
Nehemiah,2,22,"I told them of the hand of my God which was good on me, as also of the king’s words that he had spoken to me."
Nehemiah,2,23,"They said, “Let’s rise up and build.” So they strengthened their hands for the good work."
Nehemiah,2,24,"But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammontite servant, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they ridiculed us, and despised us, and said, “What is this thing that you are doing? Will you rebel against the king?”"
Nehemiah,2,25,"Then I answered them, and said to them, “The God of heaven will prosper us. Therefore we, his servants, will arise and build; but you have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.”"
Nehemiah,2,26,
Nehemiah,3,1,"Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brothers the priests, and they built the sheep gate. They sanctified it, and set up its doors. They sanctified it even to the tower of Hammeah, to the tower of Hananel."

Nehemiah,3,33,
Nehemiah,4,1,"But when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was angry, and was very indignant, and mocked the Jews."
Nehemiah,4,2,"He spoke before his brothers and the army of Samaria, and said, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they fortify themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, since they are burned?”"
Nehemiah,4,3,"Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, “What they are building, if a fox climbed up it, he would break down their stone wall.”"
Nehemiah,4,4,"“Hear, our God; for we are despised; and turn back their reproach on their own head, give them up for a plunder in a land of captivity;"
Nehemiah,4,5,"don’t cover their iniquity, and don’t let their sin be blotted out from before you; for they have insulted the builders.”"
Nehemiah,4,6,So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together to half its height: for the people had a mind to work.
Nehemiah,4,7,"But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabians, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward, and that the breaches began to be filled, they were very angry;"
Nehemiah,4,8,"and they all conspired together to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to cause confusion among us."
Nehemiah,4,9,"But we made our prayer to our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them."
Nehemiah,4,10,"Judah said, “The strength of the bearers of burdens is fading, and there is much rubble; so that we are not able to build the wall.”"
Nehemiah,4,11,"Our adversaries said, “They will not know or see, until we come in among them and kill them, and cause the work to cease.”"
Nehemiah,4,12,"When the Jews who lived by them came, they said to us ten times from all places, “Wherever you turn, they will attack us.”"
Nehemiah,4,13,"Therefore I set guards in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places. I set the people by family groups with their swords, their spears, and their bows."
Nehemiah,4,14,"I looked, and rose up, and said to the nobles, to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, “Don’t be afraid of them! Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses.”"
Nehemiah,4,15,"When our enemies heard that it was known to us, and God had brought their counsel to nothing, all of us returned to the wall, everyone to his work."
Nehemiah,4,16,"From that time forth, half of my servants did the work, and half of them held the spears, the shields, the bows, and the coats of mail; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah."
Nehemiah,4,17,"Those who built the wall, and those who bore burdens loaded themselves; everyone with one of his hands did the work, and with the other held his weapon."
Nehemiah,4,18,"Among the builders, everyone wore his sword at his side, and so built. He who sounded the trumpet was by me."
Nehemiah,4,19,"I said to the nobles, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, “The work is great and large, and we are separated on the wall, far from one another."
Nehemiah,4,20,"Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally there to us. Our God will fight for us.”"
Nehemiah,4,21,So we did the work. Half of the people held the spears from the rising of the morning until the stars appeared.
Nehemiah,4,22,"Likewise at the same time said I to the people, “Let everyone with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day.”"
Nehemiah,4,23,"So neither I, nor my brothers, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us took off our clothes. Everyone took his weapon to the water."
Nehemiah,4,24,
Nehemiah,5,1,Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brothers the Jews.
Nehemiah,5,2,"For there were that said, “We, our sons and our daughters, are many. Let us get grain, that we may eat and live.”"
Nehemiah,5,3,"There were also some that said, “We are mortgaging our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses. Let us get grain, because of the famine.”"
Nehemiah,5,4,"There were also some who said, “We have borrowed money for the king’s tribute using our fields and our vineyards as collateral."
Nehemiah,5,5,"Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children as their children. Behold, we bring our sons and our daughters into bondage to be servants, and some of our daughters have been brought into bondage. It is also not in our power to help it, because other men have our fields and our vineyards.”"
Nehemiah,5,6,I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.
Nehemiah,5,7,"Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said to them, “You exact usury, everyone of his brother.” I held a great assembly against them."
Nehemiah,5,8,"I said to them, “We, after our ability, have redeemed our brothers the Jews that were sold to the nations; and would you even sell your brothers, and should they be sold to us?” Then they held their peace, and found not a word to say."
Nehemiah,5,9,"Also I said, “The thing that you do is not good. Shouldn’t you walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?"
Nehemiah,5,10,"I likewise, my brothers and my servants, lend them money and grain. Please let us stop this usury."
Nehemiah,5,11,"Please restore to them, even today, their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that you are charging them.”"
Nehemiah,5,12,"Then they said, “We will restore them, and will require nothing of them. We will do so, even as you say.”"
Nehemiah,5,13,"Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise."
Nehemiah,5,14,"Also I shook out my lap, and said, “So may God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that doesn’t perform this promise; even be he shaken out, and emptied like this.”"
Nehemiah,5,15,"All the assembly said, “Amen,” and praised Yahweh. The people did according to this promise."
Nehemiah,5,16,"Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brothers have not eaten the bread of the governor."
Nehemiah,5,17,"But the former governors who were before me were supported by the people, and took bread and wine from them, plus forty shekels of silver; yes, even their servants ruled over the people; but I didn’t do so, because of the fear of God."
Nehemiah,5,18,"Yes, I also continued in the work of this wall. We didn’t buy any land. All my servants were gathered there to the work."
Nehemiah,5,19,"Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, one hundred fifty men, besides those who came to us from among the nations that were around us."
Nehemiah,5,20,"Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep. Also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days a store of all sorts of wine. Yet for all this, I didn’t demand the governor’s pay, because the bondage was heavy on this people."
Nehemiah,5,21,"Remember to me, my God, for good, all that I have done for this people."
Nehemiah,5,22,
Nehemiah,6,1,"Now when it was reported to Sanballat, Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and to the rest of our enemies, that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left in it (though even to that time I had not set up the doors in the gates)"
Nehemiah,6,2,"Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, “Come, let us meet together in the villages in the plain of Ono.” But they intended to harm me."
Nehemiah,6,3,"I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work, so that I can’t come down. Why should the work cease, while I leave it, and come down to you?”"
Nehemiah,6,4,They sent to me four times like this; and I answered them the same way.
Nehemiah,6,5,"Then Sanballat sent his servant to me the same way the fifth time with an open letter in his hand,"
Nehemiah,6,6,"in which was written, “It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu says it, that you and the Jews intend to rebel. Because of that, you are building the wall. You would be their king, according to these words."
Nehemiah,6,7,"You have also appointed prophets to proclaim of you at Jerusalem, saying, ‘There is a king in Judah!’ Now it will be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.”"
Nehemiah,6,8,"Then I sent to him, saying, “There are no such things done as you say, but you imagine them out of your own heart.”"
Nehemiah,6,9,"For they all would have made us afraid, saying, “Their hands will be weakened from the work, that it not be done.” But now, strengthen my hands."
Nehemiah,6,10,"I went to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut in at his home; and he said, “Let us meet together in God’s house, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple; for they will come to kill you. Yes, in the night will they come to kill you.”"
Nehemiah,6,11,"I said, “Should a man like me flee? Who is there that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.”"
Nehemiah,6,12,"I discerned, and behold, God had not sent him; but he pronounced this prophecy against me. Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him."
Nehemiah,6,13,"He hired so that I would be afraid, do so, and sin, and that they might have material for an evil report, that they might reproach me."
Nehemiah,6,14,"“Remember, my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.”"
Nehemiah,6,15,"So the wall was finished in the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in fifty-two days."
Nehemiah,6,16,"When all our enemies heard of it, all the nations that were around us were afraid, and they lost their confidence; for they perceived that this work was done by our God."
Nehemiah,6,17,"Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah’s letters came to them."
Nehemiah,6,18,"For there were many in Judah sworn to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah as wife."
Nehemiah,6,19,"Also they spoke of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear."
Nehemiah,6,20,
Nehemiah,7,1,"Now when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers and the singers and the Levites were appointed,"
Nehemiah,7,2,"I put my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the governor of the fortress, in charge of Jerusalem; for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many."
Nehemiah,7,3,"I said to them, “Don’t let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot; and while they stand guard, let them shut the doors, and you bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, everyone in his watch, with everyone near his house.”"
Nehemiah,7,4,"Now the city was wide and large; but the people were few therein, and the houses were not built."
Nehemiah,7,5,"My God put into my heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be listed by genealogy. I found the book of the genealogy of those who came up at the first, and I found this written in it:"
Nehemiah,7,6,"These are the children of the province, who went up out of the captivity of those who had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and who returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, everyone to his city;"
Nehemiah,7,7,"who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah."

Nehemiah,7,76,
Nehemiah,8,1,"All the people gathered themselves together as one man into the wide place that was in front of the water gate; and they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which Yahweh had commanded to Israel."
Nehemiah,8,2,"Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly, both men and women, and all who could hear with understanding, on the first day of the seventh month."
Nehemiah,8,3,"He read from it before the wide place that was in front of the water gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women, and of those who could understand. The ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law."
Nehemiah,8,4,"Ezra the scribe stood on a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam."

Nehemiah,8,9,"They read in the book, in the law of God, distinctly; and they gave the sense, so that they understood the reading."
Nehemiah,8,10,"Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people, said to all the people, “Today is holy to Yahweh your God. Don’t mourn, nor weep.” For all the people wept when they heard the words of the law."
Nehemiah,8,11,"Then he said to them, “Go your way. Eat the fat, drink the sweet, and send portions to him for whom nothing is prepared, for today is holy to our Lord. Don’t be grieved, for the joy of Yahweh is your strength.”"

Nehemiah,8,15,They found written in the law how Yahweh had commanded by Moses that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month;
Nehemiah,8,16,"and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, “Go out to the mountain, and get olive branches, branches of wild olive, myrtle branches, palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make temporary shelters, as it is written.”"
Nehemiah,8,17,"So the people went out, and brought them, and made themselves temporary shelters, everyone on the roof of his house, in their courts, in the courts of God’s house, in the wide place of the water gate, and in the wide place of Ephraim’s gate."
Nehemiah,8,18,"All the assembly of those who had come back out of the captivity made temporary shelters, and lived in the booths; for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun to that day the children of Israel had not done so. There was very great gladness."
Nehemiah,8,19,"Also day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. They kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according to the ordinance."
Nehemiah,8,20,
Nehemiah,9,1,"Now in the twenty-fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, with sackcloth, and dirt on them."
Nehemiah,9,2,"The offspring of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers."
Nehemiah,9,3,"They stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of Yahweh their God a fourth part of the day; and a fourth part they confessed, and worshiped Yahweh their God."
Nehemiah,9,4,"Then Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani of the Levites stood up on the stairs, and cried with a loud voice to Yahweh their God."
Nehemiah,9,5,"Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, “Stand up and bless Yahweh your God from everlasting to everlasting! Blessed be your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise!"
Nehemiah,9,6,"You are Yahweh, even you alone. You have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their army, the earth and all things that are on it, the seas and all that is in them, and you preserve them all. The army of heaven worships you."
Nehemiah,9,7,"You are Yahweh, the God who chose Abram, brought him out of Ur of the Chaldees, gave him the name of Abraham,"
Nehemiah,9,8,"found his heart faithful before you, and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, to give it to his offspring, and have performed your words; for you are righteous."
Nehemiah,9,9,"“You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heard their cry by the Red Sea,"
Nehemiah,9,10,"and showed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, and against all his servants, and against all the people of his land; for you knew that they dealt proudly against them, and made a name for yourself, as it is today."
Nehemiah,9,11,"You divided the sea before them, so that they went through the middle of the sea on the dry land; and you cast their pursuers into the depths, as a stone into the mighty waters."
Nehemiah,9,12,"Moreover, in a pillar of cloud you led them by day; and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light in the way in which they should go."
Nehemiah,9,13,"“You also came down on Mount Sinai, and spoke with them from heaven, and gave them right ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments,"
Nehemiah,9,14,"and made known to them your holy Sabbath, and commanded them commandments, statutes, and a law, by Moses your servant,"
Nehemiah,9,15,"and gave them bread from the sky for their hunger, and brought water out of the rock for them for their thirst, and commanded them that they should go in to possess the land which you had sworn to give them."
Nehemiah,9,16,"“But they and our fathers behaved proudly, hardened their neck, didn’t listen to your commandments,"
Nehemiah,9,17,"and refused to obey. They weren’t mindful of your wonders that you did among them, but hardened their neck, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage. But you are a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, and didn’t forsake them."
Nehemiah,9,18,"Yes, when they had made themselves a molten calf, and said, ‘This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt,’ and had committed awful blasphemies;"
Nehemiah,9,19,"yet you in your manifold mercies didn’t forsake them in the wilderness. The pillar of cloud didn’t depart from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither did the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way in which they should go."
Nehemiah,9,20,"You gave also your good Spirit to instruct them, and didn’t withhold your manna from their mouth, and gave them water for their thirst."
Nehemiah,9,21,"“Yes, forty years you sustained them in the wilderness. They lacked nothing. Their clothes didn’t grow old, and their feet didn’t swell."
Nehemiah,9,22,"Moreover you gave them kingdoms and peoples, which you allotted according to their portions. So they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan."
Nehemiah,9,23,"You also multiplied their children as the stars of the sky, and brought them into the land concerning which you said to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it."
Nehemiah,9,24,"“So the children went in and possessed the land, and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands, with their kings and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they pleased."
Nehemiah,9,25,"They took fortified cities and a rich land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns dug out, vineyards, and olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance. So they ate, were filled, became fat, and delighted themselves in your great goodness."
Nehemiah,9,26,"“Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against you, cast your law behind their back, killed your prophets that testified against them to turn them again to you, and they committed awful blasphemies."
Nehemiah,9,27,"Therefore you delivered them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them. In the time of their trouble, when they cried to you, you heard from heaven; and according to your manifold mercies you gave them saviors who saved them out of the hands of their adversaries."
Nehemiah,9,28,"But after they had rest, they did evil again before you; therefore left you them in the hands of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them; yet when they returned, and cried to you, you heard from heaven; and many times you delivered them according to your mercies,"
Nehemiah,9,29,"and testified against them, that you might bring them again to your law. Yet they were arrogant, and didn’t listen to your commandments, but sinned against your ordinances (which if a man does, he shall live in them), turned their backs, stiffened their neck, and would not hear."
Nehemiah,9,30,"Yet many years you put up with them, and testified against them by your Spirit through your prophets. Yet would they not give ear. Therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands."
Nehemiah,9,31,"“Nevertheless in your manifold mercies you did not make a full end of them, nor forsake them; for you are a gracious and merciful God."
Nehemiah,9,32,"Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness, don’t let all the travail seem little before you, that has come on us, on our kings, on our princes, on our priests, on our prophets, on our fathers, and on all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day."
Nehemiah,9,33,"However you are just in all that has come on us; for you have dealt truly, but we have done wickedly."
Nehemiah,9,34,"Also our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers have not kept your law, nor listened to your commandments and your testimonies with which you testified against them."
Nehemiah,9,35,"For they have not served you in their kingdom, and in your great goodness that you gave them, and in the large and rich land which you gave before them. They did not turn from their wicked works."
Nehemiah,9,36,"“Behold, we are servants today, and as for the land that you gave to our fathers to eat its fruit and its good, behold, we are servants in it."
Nehemiah,9,37,"It yields much increase to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins. Also they have power over our bodies and over our livestock, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress."
Nehemiah,9,38,"Yet for all this, we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, our Levites, and our priests, seal it.”"

Nehemiah,10,29,"they joined with their brothers, their nobles, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in God’s law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of Yahweh our Lord, and his ordinances and his statutes;"
Nehemiah,10,30,"and that we would not give our daughters to the peoples of the land, nor take their daughters for our sons;"
Nehemiah,10,31,"and if the peoples of the land bring wares or any grain on the Sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy from them on the Sabbath, or on a holy day; and that we would forego the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt."

Nehemiah,10,39,"For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the wave offering of the grain, of the new wine, and of the oil, to the rooms, where the vessels of the sanctuary are, and the priests who minister, with the gatekeepers and the singers. We will not forsake the house of our God."

Nehemiah,12,26,"These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest and scribe."
Nehemiah,12,27,"At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with giving thanks, and with singing, with cymbals, stringed instruments, and with harps."
Nehemiah,12,28,"The sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain around Jerusalem and from the villages of the Netophathites;"
Nehemiah,12,29,"also from Beth Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had built themselves villages around Jerusalem."
Nehemiah,12,30,"The priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people, and the gates, and the wall."
Nehemiah,12,31,"Then I brought up the princes of Judah on the wall, and appointed two great companies who gave thanks and went in procession. One went on the right hand on the wall toward the dung gate;"
Nehemiah,12,32,"and after them went Hoshaiah, with half of the princes of Judah,"

Nehemiah,12,37,"By the spring gate, and straight before them, they went up by the stairs of David’s city, at the ascent of the wall, above David’s house, even to the water gate eastward."
Nehemiah,12,38,"The other company of those who gave thanks went to meet them, and I after them, with the half of the people, on the wall, above the tower of the furnaces, even to the wide wall,"
Nehemiah,12,39,"and above the gate of Ephraim, and by the old gate, and by the fish gate, and the tower of Hananel, and the tower of Hammeah, even to the sheep gate: and they stood still in the gate of the guard."
Nehemiah,12,40,"So the two companies of those who gave thanks in God’s house stood, and I, and the half of the rulers with me;"
Nehemiah,12,41,"and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;"
Nehemiah,12,42,"and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. The singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer."
Nehemiah,12,43,"They offered great sacrifices that day, and rejoiced; for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and the women and the children also rejoiced; so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even far away."
Nehemiah,12,44,"On that day were men appointed over the rooms for the treasures, for the wave offerings, for the first fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, according to the fields of the cities, the portions appointed by the law for the priests and Levites; for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites who waited."
Nehemiah,12,45,"They performed the duty of their God, and the duty of the purification, and so did the singers and the gatekeepers, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son."
Nehemiah,12,46,"For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God."
Nehemiah,12,47,"All Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the gatekeepers, as every day required; and they set apart that which was for the Levites; and the Levites set apart that which was for the sons of Aaron."
Nehemiah,12,48,
Nehemiah,13,1,"On that day they read in the book of Moses in the hearing of the people; and it was found written in it that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God forever,"
Nehemiah,13,2,"because they didn’t meet the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, to curse them; however our God turned the curse into a blessing."
Nehemiah,13,3,"It came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated all the mixed multitude from Israel."
Nehemiah,13,4,"Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the rooms of the house of our God, being allied to Tobiah,"
Nehemiah,13,5,"had prepared for him a great room, where before they laid the meal offerings, the frankincense, the vessels, and the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, the singers, and the gatekeepers; and the wave offerings for the priests."
Nehemiah,13,6,"But in all this, I was not at Jerusalem; for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king; and after some days I asked leave of the king,"
Nehemiah,13,7,"and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing him a room in the courts of God’s house."
Nehemiah,13,8,It grieved me severely. Therefore I threw all Tobiah’s household stuff out of the room.
Nehemiah,13,9,"Then I commanded, and they cleansed the rooms. I brought into them the vessels of God’s house, with the meal offerings and the frankincense again."
Nehemiah,13,10,"I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them; so that the Levites and the singers, who did the work, had each fled to his field."
Nehemiah,13,11,"Then I contended with the rulers, and said, “Why is God’s house forsaken?” I gathered them together, and set them in their place."
Nehemiah,13,12,"Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain, the new wine, and the oil to the treasuries."
Nehemiah,13,13,"I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their business was to distribute to their brothers."
Nehemiah,13,14,"Remember me, my God, concerning this, and don’t wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for its observances."
Nehemiah,13,15,"In those days saw I in Judah some men treading wine presses on the Sabbath, bringing in sheaves, and loading donkeys; also with wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day; and I testified against them in the day in which they sold food."
Nehemiah,13,16,"Some men of Tyre also lived there, who brought in fish and all kinds of wares, and sold on the Sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem."
Nehemiah,13,17,"Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, “What evil thing is this that you do, and profane the Sabbath day?"
Nehemiah,13,18,"Didn’t your fathers do thus, and didn’t our God bring all this evil on us, and on this city? Yet you bring more wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath.”"
Nehemiah,13,19,"It came to pass that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath. I set some of my servants over the gates, so that no burden should be brought in on the Sabbath day."
Nehemiah,13,20,So the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares camped outside of Jerusalem once or twice.
Nehemiah,13,21,"Then I testified against them, and said to them, “Why do you stay around the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you.” From that time on, they didn’t come on the Sabbath."
Nehemiah,13,22,"I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the Sabbath day. Remember to me, my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of your loving kindness."
Nehemiah,13,23,"In those days I also saw the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab;"
Nehemiah,13,24,"and their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews’ language, but according to the language of each people."
Nehemiah,13,25,"I contended with them, and cursed them, and struck certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, “You shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves."
Nehemiah,13,26,"Didn’t Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet among many nations was there no king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel. Nevertheless foreign women caused even him to sin."
Nehemiah,13,27,"Shall we then listen to you to do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women?”"
Nehemiah,13,28,"One of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite; therefore I chased him from me."
Nehemiah,13,29,"Remember them, my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites."
Nehemiah,13,30,"Thus I cleansed them from all foreigners, and appointed duties for the priests and for the Levites, everyone in his work;"
Nehemiah,13,31,"and for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the first fruits. Remember me, my God, for good."
Nehemiah,13,32,
Esther,1,1,"Now in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Ethiopia, over one hundred twenty-seven provinces),"
Esther,1,2,"in those days, when the King Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,"
Esther,1,3,"in the third year of his reign, he made a feast for all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him."
Esther,1,4,"He displayed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, even one hundred eighty days."
Esther,1,5,"When these days were fulfilled, the king made a seven day feast for all the people who were present in Shushan the palace, both great and small, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace."
Esther,1,6,"There were hangings of white, green, and blue material, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and marble pillars. The couches were of gold and silver, on a pavement of red, white, yellow, and black marble."
Esther,1,7,"They gave them drinks in golden vessels of various kinds, including royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of the king."
Esther,1,8,"In accordance with the law, the drinking was not compulsory; for so the king had instructed all the officials of his house, that they should do according to every man’s pleasure."
Esther,1,9,Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to King Ahasuerus.
Esther,1,10,"On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcass, the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,"
Esther,1,11,"to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the royal crown, to show the people and the princes her beauty; for she was beautiful."
Esther,1,12,"But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment by the eunuchs. Therefore the king was very angry, and his anger burned in him."
Esther,1,13,"Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times (for it was the king’s custom to consult those who knew law and judgment;"
Esther,1,14,"and the next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king’s face, and sat first in the kingdom),"
Esther,1,15,"“What shall we do to the queen Vashti according to law, because she has not done the bidding of the King Ahasuerus by the eunuchs?”"
Esther,1,16,"Memucan answered before the king and the princes, “Vashti the queen has not done wrong to just the king, but also to all the princes, and to all the people who are in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus."
Esther,1,17,"For this deed of the queen will become known to all women, causing them to show contempt for their husbands, when it is reported, ‘King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she didn’t come.’"
Esther,1,18,"Today, the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen’s deed will tell all the king’s princes. This will cause much contempt and wrath."
Esther,1,19,"“If it pleases the king, let a royal commandment go from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, so that it cannot be altered, that Vashti may never again come before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate to another who is better than she."
Esther,1,20,"When the king’s decree which he shall make is published throughout all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give their husbands honor, both great and small.”"
Esther,1,21,"This advice pleased the king and the princes, and the king did according to the word of Memucan:"
Esther,1,22,"for he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every province according to its writing, and to every people in their language, that every man should rule his own house, speaking in the language of his own people."
Esther,1,23,
Esther,2,1,"After these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her."
Esther,2,2,"Then the king’s servants who served him said, “Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king."
Esther,2,3,"Let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the beautiful young virgins to the citadel of Susa, to the women’s house, to the custody of Hegai the king’s eunuch, keeper of the women. Let cosmetics be given them;"
Esther,2,4,"and let the maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.” The thing pleased the king, and he did so."
Esther,2,5,"There was a certain Jew in the citadel of Susa, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,"
Esther,2,6,"who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away."
Esther,2,7,"He brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter; for she had neither father nor mother. The maiden was fair and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter."
Esther,2,8,"So, when the king’s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together to the citadel of Susa, to the custody of Hegai, Esther was taken into the king’s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women."
Esther,2,9,"The maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness from him. He quickly gave her cosmetics and her portions of food, and the seven choice maidens who were to be given her out of the king’s house. He moved her and her maidens to the best place in the women’s house."
Esther,2,10,"Esther had not made known her people nor her relatives, because Mordecai had instructed her that she should not make it known."
Esther,2,11,"Mordecai walked every day in front of the court of the women’s house, to find out how Esther was doing, and what would become of her."
Esther,2,12,"Each young woman’s turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus after her purification for twelve months (for so were the days of their purification accomplished, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet fragrances and with preparations for beautifying women)."
Esther,2,13,The young woman then came to the king like this: whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the women’s house to the king’s house.
Esther,2,14,"In the evening she went, and on the next day she returned into the second women’s house, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch, who kept the concubines. She came in to the king no more, unless the king delighted in her, and she was called by name."
Esther,2,15,"Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, came to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s eunuch, the keeper of the women, advised. Esther obtained favor in the sight of all those who looked at her."
Esther,2,16,"So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign."
Esther,2,17,"The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti."
Esther,2,18,"Then the king made a great feast for all his princes and his servants, even Esther’s feast; and he proclaimed a holiday in the provinces, and gave gifts according to the king’s bounty."
Esther,2,19,"When the virgins were gathered together the second time, Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate."
Esther,2,20,"Esther had not yet made known her relatives nor her people, as Mordecai had commanded her; for Esther obeyed Mordecai, like she did when she was brought up by him."
Esther,2,21,"In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate, two of the king’s eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, who were doorkeepers, were angry, and sought to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus."
Esther,2,22,"This thing became known to Mordecai, who informed Esther the queen; and Esther informed the king in Mordecai’s name."
Esther,2,23,"When this matter was investigated, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree; and it was written in the book of the chronicles in the king’s presence."
Esther,2,24,
Esther,3,1,"After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes who were with him."
Esther,3,2,"All the king’s servants who were in the king’s gate bowed down, and paid homage to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai didn’t bow down or pay him homage."
Esther,3,3,"Then the king’s servants, who were in the king’s gate, said to Mordecai, “Why do you disobey the king’s commandment?”"
Esther,3,4,"Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he didn’t listen to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s reason would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew."
Esther,3,5,"When Haman saw that Mordecai didn’t bow down, nor pay him homage, Haman was full of wrath."
Esther,3,6,"But he scorned the thought of laying hands on Mordecai alone, for they had made known to him Mordecai’s people. Therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even Mordecai’s people."
Esther,3,7,"In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, and chose the twelfth month, which is the month Adar."
Esther,3,8,"Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom, and their laws are different than other people’s. They don’t keep the king’s laws. Therefore it is not for the king’s profit to allow them to remain."
Esther,3,9,"If it pleases the king, let it be written that they be destroyed; and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who are in charge of the king’s business, to bring it into the king’s treasuries.”"
Esther,3,10,"The king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews’ enemy."
Esther,3,11,"The king said to Haman, “The silver is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you.”"
Esther,3,12,"Then the king’s scribes were called in on the first month, on the thirteenth day of the month; and all that Haman commanded was written to the king’s satraps, and to the governors who were over every province, and to the princes of every people, to every province according to its writing, and to every people in their language. It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus, and it was sealed with the king’s ring."
Esther,3,13,"Letters were sent by couriers into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to plunder their possessions."
Esther,3,14,"A copy of the letter, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published to all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day."
Esther,3,15,"The couriers went out in haste by the king’s commandment, and the decree was given out in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was perplexed."
Esther,3,16,
Esther,4,1,"Now when Mordecai found out all that was done, Mordecai tore his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the middle of the city, and wailed loudly and bitterly."
Esther,4,2,"He came even before the king’s gate, for no one is allowed inside the king’s gate clothed with sackcloth."
Esther,4,3,"In every province, wherever the king’s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes."
Esther,4,4,"Esther’s maidens and her eunuchs came and told her this, and the queen was exceedingly grieved. She sent clothing to Mordecai, to replace his sackcloth; but he didn’t receive it."
Esther,4,5,"Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs, whom he had appointed to attend her, and commanded him to go to Mordecai, to find out what this was, and why it was."
Esther,4,6,"So Hathach went out to Mordecai, to city square which was before the king’s gate."
Esther,4,7,"Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king’s treasuries for the destruction of the Jews."
Esther,4,8,"He also gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it to Esther, and to declare it to her, and to urge her to go in to the king, to make supplication to him, and to make request before him, for her people."
Esther,4,9,Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
Esther,4,10,"Then Esther spoke to Hathach, and gave him a message to Mordecai:"
Esther,4,11,"“All the king’s servants, and the people of the king’s provinces, know, that whoever, whether man or woman, comes to the king into the inner court without being called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king might hold out the golden scepter, that he may live. I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.”"
Esther,4,12,They told to Mordecai Esther’s words.
Esther,4,13,Then Mordecai asked them to return this answer to Esther: “Don’t think to yourself that you will escape in the king’s house any more than all the Jews.
Esther,4,14,"For if you remain silent now, then relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from another place, but you and your father’s house will perish. Who knows if you haven’t come to the kingdom for such a time as this?”"
Esther,4,15,"Then Esther asked them to answer Mordecai,"
Esther,4,16,"“Go, gather together all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and fast for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day. I and my maidens will also fast the same way. Then I will go in to the king, which is against the law; and if I perish, I perish.”"
Esther,4,17,"So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him."
Esther,4,18,
Esther,5,1,"Now on the third day, Esther put on her royal clothing, and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, next to the king’s house. The king sat on his royal throne in the royal house, next to the entrance of the house."
Esther,5,2,"When the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, she obtained favor in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther came near, and touched the top of the scepter."
Esther,5,3,"Then the king asked her, “What would you like, queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given you even to the half of the kingdom.”"
Esther,5,4,"Esther said, “If it seems good to the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.”"
Esther,5,5,"Then the king said, “Bring Haman quickly, so that it may be done as Esther has said.” So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared."
Esther,5,6,"The king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, “What is your petition? It shall be granted you. What is your request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.”"
Esther,5,7,"Then Esther answered and said, “My petition and my request is this."
Esther,5,8,"If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I will prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king has said.”"
Esther,5,9,"Then Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart, but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, that he didn’t stand up nor move for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai."
Esther,5,10,"Nevertheless Haman restrained himself, and went home. There, he sent and called for his friends and Zeresh his wife."
Esther,5,11,"Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, the multitude of his children, all the things in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king."
Esther,5,12,"Haman also said, “Yes, Esther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and tomorrow I am also invited by her together with the king."
Esther,5,13,"Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.”"
Esther,5,14,"Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, “Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on it. Then go in merrily with the king to the banquet.” This pleased Haman, so he had the gallows made."
Esther,5,15,
Esther,6,1,"On that night, the king couldn’t sleep. He commanded the book of records of the chronicles to be brought, and they were read to the king."
Esther,6,2,"It was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs, who were doorkeepers, who had tried to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus."
Esther,6,3,"The king said, “What honor and dignity has been given to Mordecai for this?”"
Esther,6,4,"Then the king’s servants who attended him said, “Nothing has been done for him.”"
Esther,6,5,"The king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had come into the outer court of the king’s house, to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him."
Esther,6,6,"The king’s servants said to him, “Behold, Haman stands in the court.”"
Esther,6,7,"The king said, “Let him come in.”"
Esther,6,8,"So Haman came in. The king said to him, “What shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor?”"
Esther,6,9,"Now Haman said in his heart, “Who would the king delight to honor more than myself?”"
Esther,6,10,"Haman said to the king, “For the man whom the king delights to honor,"
Esther,6,11,"let royal clothing be brought which the king uses to wear, and the horse that the king rides on, and on the head of which a crown royal is set."
Esther,6,12,"Let the clothing and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes, that they may array the man whom the king delights to honor with them, and have him ride on horseback through the city square, and proclaim before him, ‘Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!’”"
Esther,6,13,"Then the king said to Haman, “Hurry and take the clothing and the horse, as you have said, and do this for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king’s gate. Let nothing fail of all that you have spoken.”"
Esther,6,14,"Then Haman took the clothing and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and had him ride through the city square, and proclaimed before him, “Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!”"
Esther,6,15,"Mordecai came back to the king’s gate, but Haman hurried to his house, mourning and having his head covered."
Esther,6,16,"Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, “If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of Jewish descent, you will not prevail against him, but you will surely fall before him.”"
Esther,6,17,"While they were yet talking with him, the king’s eunuchs came, and hurried to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared."
Esther,6,18,
Esther,7,1,So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.
Esther,7,2,"The king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, “What is your petition, queen Esther? It shall be granted you. What is your request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.”"
Esther,7,3,"Then Esther the queen answered, “If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request."
Esther,7,4,"For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for male and female slaves, I would have held my peace, although the adversary could not have compensated for the king’s loss.”"
Esther,7,5,"Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen, “Who is he, and where is he who dared presume in his heart to do so?”"
Esther,7,6,"Esther said, “An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman!”"
Esther,7,7,Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.
Esther,7,8,The king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden. Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.
Esther,7,9,"Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman had fallen on the couch where Esther was. Then the king said, “Will he even assault the queen in front of me in the house?” As the word went out of the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face."
Esther,7,10,"Then Harbonah, one of the eunuchs who were with the king said, “Behold, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman has made for Mordecai, who spoke good for the king, is standing at Haman’s house.”"
Esther,7,11,"The king said, “Hang him on it!”"
Esther,7,12,So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king’s wrath pacified.
Esther,7,13,
Esther,8,1,"On that day, King Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman, the Jews’ enemy, to Esther the queen. Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was to her."
Esther,8,2,"The king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman."
Esther,8,3,"Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and begged him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his plan that he had planned against the Jews."
Esther,8,4,"Then the king held out to Esther the golden scepter. So Esther arose, and stood before the king."
Esther,8,5,"She said, “If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing seem right to the king, and I am pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the king’s provinces."
Esther,8,6,For how can I endure to see the evil that would come to my people? How can I endure to see the destruction of my relatives?”
Esther,8,7,"Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, “See, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged on the gallows, because he laid his hand on the Jews."
Esther,8,8,"Write also to the Jews, as it pleases you, in the king’s name, and seal it with the king’s ring; for the writing which is written in the king’s name, and sealed with the king’s ring, may not be reversed by any man.”"
Esther,8,9,"Then the king’s scribes were called at that time, in the third month, which is the month Sivan, on the twenty-third day of the month; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded to the Jews, and to the satraps, and the governors and princes of the provinces which are from India to Ethiopia, one hundred twenty-seven provinces, to every province according to its writing, and to every people in their language, and to the Jews in their writing, and in their language."
Esther,8,10,"He wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king’s ring, and sent letters by courier on horseback, riding on royal horses that were bred from swift steeds."
Esther,8,11,"In those letters, the king granted the Jews who were in every city to gather themselves together, and to defend their life, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, their little ones and women, and to plunder their possessions,"
Esther,8,12,"on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar."
Esther,8,13,"A copy of the letter, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published to all the peoples, that the Jews should be ready for that day to avenge themselves on their enemies."
Esther,8,14,"So the couriers who rode on royal horses went out, hastened and pressed on by the king’s commandment. The decree was given out in the citadel of Susa."
Esther,8,15,"Mordecai went out of the presence of the king in royal clothing of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a robe of fine linen and purple; and the city of Susa shouted and was glad."
Esther,8,16,"The Jews had light, gladness, joy, and honor."
Esther,8,17,"In every province, and in every city, wherever the king’s commandment and his decree came, the Jews had gladness, joy, a feast, and a good day. Many from among the peoples of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews was fallen on them."
Esther,8,18,
Esther,9,1,"Now in the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the month, when the king’s commandment and his decree came near to be put in execution, on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to conquer them, (but it was turned out the opposite happened, that the Jews conquered those who hated them),"
Esther,9,2,"the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus, to lay hands on those who wanted to harm them. No one could withstand them, because the fear of them had fallen on all the people."
Esther,9,3,"All the princes of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and those who did the king’s business helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them."
Esther,9,4,"For Mordecai was great in the king’s house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai grew greater and greater."
Esther,9,5,"The Jews struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and with slaughter and destruction, and did what they wanted to those who hated them."
Esther,9,6,"In the citadel of Susa, the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men."
Esther,9,7,"They killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,"
Esther,9,8,"Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,"
Esther,9,9,"Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha,"
Esther,9,10,"the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews’ enemy, but they didn’t lay their hand on the plunder."
Esther,9,11,"On that day, the number of those who were slain in the citadel of Susa was brought before the king."
Esther,9,12,"The king said to Esther the queen, “The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in the citadel of Susa, including the ten sons of Haman; what then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces! Now what is your petition? It shall be granted you. What is your further request? It shall be done.”"
Esther,9,13,"Then Esther said, “If it pleases the king, let it be granted to the Jews who are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according to today’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the gallows.”"
Esther,9,14,The king commanded this to be done. A decree was given out in Shushan; and they hanged Haman’s ten sons.
Esther,9,15,"The Jews who were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and killed three hundred men in Shushan; but they didn’t lay their hand on the plunder."
Esther,9,16,"The other Jews who were in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together, defended their lives, had rest from their enemies, and killed seventy-five thousand of those who hated them; but they didn’t lay their hand on the plunder."
Esther,9,17,This was done on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of that month they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
Esther,9,18,"But the Jews who were in Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth days of the month; and on the fifteenth day of that month, they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness."
Esther,9,19,"Therefore the Jews of the villages, who live in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, a good day, and a day of sending presents of food to one another."
Esther,9,20,"Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both near and far,"
Esther,9,21,"to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month Adar yearly,"
Esther,9,22,"as the days in which the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned to them from sorrow to gladness, and from mourning into a good day; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending presents of food to one another, and gifts to the needy."
Esther,9,23,"The Jews accepted the custom that they had begun, as Mordecai had written to them;"
Esther,9,24,"because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast “Pur”, that is the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;"
Esther,9,25,"but when this became known to the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked plan, which he had planned against the Jews, should return on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows."
Esther,9,26,"Therefore they called these days “Purim”, from the word “Pur.” Therefore because of all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and that which had come to them,"
Esther,9,27,"the Jews established, and imposed on themselves, and on their descendants, and on all those who joined themselves to them, so that it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to what was written, and according to its appointed time, every year;"
Esther,9,28,"and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor their memory perish from their offspring,"
Esther,9,29,"Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim."
Esther,9,30,"He sent letters to all the Jews, to the hundred twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,"
Esther,9,31,"to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times, as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had decreed, and as they had imposed upon themselves and their descendants, in the matter of the fastings and their cry."
Esther,9,32,The commandment of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.
Esther,9,33,
Esther,10,1,"King Ahasuerus laid a tribute on the land, and on the islands of the sea."
Esther,10,2,"All the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?"
Esther,10,3,"For Mordecai the Jew was next to King Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted by the multitude of his brothers, seeking the good of his people, and speaking peace to all his descendants."
Esther,10,4,
Job,1,1,"There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job. That man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God, and turned away from evil."
Job,1,2,There were born to him seven sons and three daughters.
Job,1,3,"His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east."
Job,1,4,His sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
Job,1,5,"It was so, when the days of their feasting had run their course, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, “It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts.” Job did so continually."
Job,1,6,"Now on the day when God’s sons came to present themselves before Yahweh, Satan also came among them."
Job,1,7,"Yahweh said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”"
Job,1,8,"Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.”"
Job,1,9,"Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant, Job? For there is no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil.”"
Job,1,10,"Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing?"
Job,1,11,"Haven’t you made a hedge around him, and around his house, and around all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land."
Job,1,12,"But stretch out your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will renounce you to your face.”"
Job,1,13,"Yahweh said to Satan, “Behold, all that he has is in your power. Only on himself don’t stretch out your hand.”"
Job,1,14,So Satan went out from the presence of Yahweh.
Job,1,15,"It fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,"
Job,1,16,"that there came a messenger to Job, and said, “The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys feeding beside them,"
Job,1,17,"and the Sabeans attacked, and took them away. Yes, they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”"
Job,1,18,"While he was still speaking, there also came another, and said, “The fire of God has fallen from the sky, and has burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”"
Job,1,19,"While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, “The Chaldeans made three bands, and swept down on the camels, and have taken them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you.”"
Job,1,20,"While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,"
Job,1,21,"and behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead. I alone have escaped to tell you.”"
Job,1,22,"Then Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshiped."
Job,1,23,"He said, “Naked I came out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return there. Yahweh gave, and Yahweh has taken away. Blessed be Yahweh’s name.”"
Job,1,24,"In all this, Job did not sin, nor charge God with wrongdoing."
Job,1,25,
Job,2,1,"Again, on the day when the God’s sons came to present themselves before Yahweh, Satan came also among them to present himself before Yahweh."
Job,2,2,"Yahweh said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”"
Job,2,3,"Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.”"
Job,2,4,"Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? For there is no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil. He still maintains his integrity, although you incited me against him, to ruin him without cause.”"
Job,2,5,"Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “Skin for skin. Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life."
Job,2,6,"But stretch out your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce you to your face.”"
Job,2,7,"Yahweh said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your hand. Only spare his life.”"
Job,2,8,"So Satan went out from the presence of Yahweh, and struck Job with painful sores from the sole of his foot to his head."
Job,2,9,"He took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with, and he sat among the ashes."
Job,2,10,"Then his wife said to him, “Do you still maintain your integrity? Renounce God, and die.”"
Job,2,11,"But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?”"
Job,2,12,In all this Job didn’t sin with his lips.
Job,2,13,"Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that had come on him, they each came from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and to comfort him."
Job,2,14,"When they lifted up their eyes from a distance, and didn’t recognize him, they raised their voices, and wept; and they each tore his robe, and sprinkled dust on their heads toward the sky."
Job,2,15,"So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great."
Job,2,16,
Job,3,1,"After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed the day of his birth."
Job,3,2,Job answered:
Job,3,3,"“Let the day perish in which I was born,"
Job,3,4,"the night which said, ‘There is a boy conceived.’"
Job,3,5,Let that day be darkness.
Job,3,6,"Don’t let God from above seek for it,"
Job,3,7,neither let the light shine on it.
Job,3,8,Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own.
Job,3,9,Let a cloud dwell on it.
Job,3,10,Let all that makes black the day terrify it.
Job,3,11,"As for that night, let thick darkness seize on it."
Job,3,12,Let it not rejoice among the days of the year.
Job,3,13,Let it not come into the number of the months.
Job,3,14,"Behold, let that night be barren."
Job,3,15,Let no joyful voice come therein.
Job,3,16,"Let them curse it who curse the day,"
Job,3,17,who are ready to rouse up leviathan.
Job,3,18,Let the stars of its twilight be dark.
Job,3,19,"Let it look for light, but have none,"
Job,3,20,"neither let it see the eyelids of the morning,"
Job,3,21,"because it didn’t shut up the doors of my mother’s womb,"
Job,3,22,nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.
Job,3,23,“Why didn’t I die from the womb?
Job,3,24,Why didn’t I give up the spirit when my mother bore me?
Job,3,25,Why did the knees receive me?
Job,3,26,"Or why the breast, that I should nurse?"
Job,3,27,For now should I have lain down and been quiet.
Job,3,28,"I should have slept, then I would have been at rest,"
Job,3,29,"with kings and counselors of the earth,"
Job,3,30,who built up waste places for themselves;
Job,3,31,"or with princes who had gold,"
Job,3,32,who filled their houses with silver:
Job,3,33,"or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been,"
Job,3,34,as infants who never saw light.
Job,3,35,There the wicked cease from troubling.
Job,3,36,There the weary are at rest.
Job,3,37,There the prisoners are at ease together.
Job,3,38,They don’t hear the voice of the taskmaster.
Job,3,39,The small and the great are there.
Job,3,40,The servant is free from his master.
Job,3,41,"“Why is light given to him who is in misery,"
Job,3,42,"life to the bitter in soul,"
Job,3,43,"Who long for death, but it doesn’t come;"
Job,3,44,"and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,"
Job,3,45,"who rejoice exceedingly,"
Job,3,46,"and are glad, when they can find the grave?"
Job,3,47,"Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden,"
Job,3,48,whom God has hedged in?
Job,3,49,For my sighing comes before I eat.
Job,3,50,My groanings are poured out like water.
Job,3,51,"For the thing which I fear comes on me,"
Job,3,52,That which I am afraid of comes to me.
Job,3,53,"I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest;"
Job,3,54,but trouble comes.”
Job,3,55,
Job,4,1,"Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,"
Job,4,2,"“If someone ventures to talk with you, will you be grieved?"
Job,4,3,But who can withhold himself from speaking?
Job,4,4,"Behold, you have instructed many,"
Job,4,5,you have strengthened the weak hands.
Job,4,6,"Your words have supported him who was falling,"
Job,4,7,You have made firm the feeble knees.
Job,4,8,"But now it has come to you, and you faint."
Job,4,9,"It touches you, and you are troubled."
Job,4,10,Isn’t your piety your confidence?
Job,4,11,Isn’t the integrity of your ways your hope?
Job,4,12,"“Remember, now, whoever perished, being innocent?"
Job,4,13,Or where were the upright cut off?
Job,4,14,"According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity,"
Job,4,15,"and sow trouble,"
Job,4,16,reap the same.
Job,4,17,By the breath of God they perish.
Job,4,18,By the blast of his anger are they consumed.
Job,4,19,"The roaring of the lion,"
Job,4,20,"and the voice of the fierce lion,"
Job,4,21,"the teeth of the young lions, are broken."
Job,4,22,The old lion perishes for lack of prey.
Job,4,23,The cubs of the lioness are scattered abroad.
Job,4,24,“Now a thing was secretly brought to me.
Job,4,25,My ear received a whisper of it.
Job,4,26,"In thoughts from the visions of the night,"
Job,4,27,"when deep sleep falls on men,"
Job,4,28,"fear came on me, and trembling,"
Job,4,29,which made all my bones shake.
Job,4,30,Then a spirit passed before my face.
Job,4,31,The hair of my flesh stood up.
Job,4,32,"It stood still, but I couldn’t discern its appearance."
Job,4,33,A form was before my eyes.
Job,4,34,"Silence, then I heard a voice, saying,"
Job,4,35,‘Shall mortal man be more just than God?
Job,4,36,Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?
Job,4,37,"Behold, he puts no trust in his servants."
Job,4,38,He charges his angels with error.
Job,4,39,"How much more, those who dwell in houses of clay,"
Job,4,40,"whose foundation is in the dust,"
Job,4,41,who are crushed before the moth!
Job,4,42,Between morning and evening they are destroyed.
Job,4,43,They perish forever without any regarding it.
Job,4,44,Isn’t their tent cord plucked up within them?
Job,4,45,"They die, and that without wisdom.’"
Job,4,46,
Job,5,1,“Call now; is there any who will answer you?
Job,5,2,To which of the holy ones will you turn?
Job,5,3,"For resentment kills the foolish man,"
Job,5,4,and jealousy kills the simple.
Job,5,5,"I have seen the foolish taking root,"
Job,5,6,but suddenly I cursed his habitation.
Job,5,7,His children are far from safety.
Job,5,8,They are crushed in the gate.
Job,5,9,"Neither is there any to deliver them,"
Job,5,10,"whose harvest the hungry eats up,"
Job,5,11,and take it even out of the thorns.
Job,5,12,The snare gapes for their substance.
Job,5,13,"For affliction doesn’t come out of the dust,"
Job,5,14,neither does trouble spring out of the ground;
Job,5,15,"but man is born to trouble,"
Job,5,16,as the sparks fly upward.
Job,5,17,"“But as for me, I would seek God."
Job,5,18,"I would commit my cause to God,"
Job,5,19,"who does great things that can’t be fathomed,"
Job,5,20,marvelous things without number;
Job,5,21,"who gives rain on the earth,"
Job,5,22,and sends waters on the fields;
Job,5,23,"so that he sets up on high those who are low,"
Job,5,24,those who mourn are exalted to safety.
Job,5,25,"He frustrates the plans of the crafty,"
Job,5,26,So that their hands can’t perform their enterprise.
Job,5,27,He takes the wise in their own craftiness;
Job,5,28,the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.
Job,5,29,"They meet with darkness in the day time,"
Job,5,30,and grope at noonday as in the night.
Job,5,31,"But he saves from the sword of their mouth,"
Job,5,32,even the needy from the hand of the mighty.
Job,5,33,"So the poor has hope,"
Job,5,34,and injustice shuts her mouth.
Job,5,35,"“Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects."
Job,5,36,Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty.
Job,5,37,"For he wounds, and binds up."
Job,5,38,"He injures, and his hands make whole."
Job,5,39,He will deliver you in six troubles;
Job,5,40,"yes, in seven no evil shall touch you."
Job,5,41,In famine he will redeem you from death;
Job,5,42,"in war, from the power of the sword."
Job,5,43,"You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue,"
Job,5,44,neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes.
Job,5,45,"At destruction and famine you shall laugh,"
Job,5,46,neither shall you be afraid of the animals of the earth.
Job,5,47,For you shall be allied with the stones of the field.
Job,5,48,The animals of the field shall be at peace with you.
Job,5,49,You shall know that your tent is in peace.
Job,5,50,"You shall visit your fold, and shall miss nothing."
Job,5,51,"You shall know also that your offspring shall be great,"
Job,5,52,Your offspring as the grass of the earth.
Job,5,53,"You shall come to your grave in a full age,"
Job,5,54,like a shock of grain comes in its season.
Job,5,55,"Look this, we have searched it, so it is."
Job,5,56,"Hear it, and know it for your good.”"
Job,5,57,
Job,6,1,"Then Job answered,"
Job,6,2,"“Oh that my anguish were weighed,"
Job,6,3,and all my calamity laid in the balances!
Job,6,4,"For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas,"
Job,6,5,therefore have my words been rash.
Job,6,6,For the arrows of the Almighty are within me.
Job,6,7,My spirit drinks up their poison.
Job,6,8,The terrors of God set themselves in array against me.
Job,6,9,Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass?
Job,6,10,Or does the ox low over his fodder?
Job,6,11,Can that which has no flavor be eaten without salt?
Job,6,12,Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
Job,6,13,My soul refuses to touch them.
Job,6,14,They are as loathsome food to me.
Job,6,15,"“Oh that I might have my request,"
Job,6,16,"that God would grant the thing that I long for,"
Job,6,17,even that it would please God to crush me;
Job,6,18,"that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!"
Job,6,19,"Be it still my consolation,"
Job,6,20,"yes, let me exult in pain that doesn’t spare,"
Job,6,21,that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
Job,6,22,"What is my strength, that I should wait?"
Job,6,23,"What is my end, that I should be patient?"
Job,6,24,Is my strength the strength of stones?
Job,6,25,Or is my flesh of brass?
Job,6,26,"Isn’t it that I have no help in me,"
Job,6,27,That wisdom is driven quite from me?
Job,6,28,"“To him who is ready to faint, kindness should be shown from his friend;"
Job,6,29,even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
Job,6,30,"My brothers have dealt deceitfully as a brook,"
Job,6,31,as the channel of brooks that pass away;
Job,6,32,"Which are black by reason of the ice,"
Job,6,33,in which the snow hides itself.
Job,6,34,"In the dry season, they vanish."
Job,6,35,"When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place."
Job,6,36,The caravans that travel beside them turn away.
Job,6,37,"They go up into the waste, and perish."
Job,6,38,The caravans of Tema looked.
Job,6,39,The companies of Sheba waited for them.
Job,6,40,They were distressed because they were confident.
Job,6,41,"They came there, and were confounded."
Job,6,42,For now you are nothing.
Job,6,43,"You see a terror, and are afraid."
Job,6,44,"Did I say, ‘Give to me?’"
Job,6,45,"or, ‘Offer a present for me from your substance?’"
Job,6,46,"or, ‘Deliver me from the adversary’s hand?’"
Job,6,47,"or, ‘Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?’"
Job,6,48,"“Teach me, and I will hold my peace."
Job,6,49,Cause me to understand wherein I have erred.
Job,6,50,How forcible are words of uprightness!
Job,6,51,"But your reproof, what does it reprove?"
Job,6,52,"Do you intend to reprove words,"
Job,6,53,since the speeches of one who is desperate are as wind?
Job,6,54,"Yes, you would even cast lots for the fatherless,"
Job,6,55,and make merchandise of your friend.
Job,6,56,"Now therefore be pleased to look at me,"
Job,6,57,for surely I shall not lie to your face.
Job,6,58,Please return.
Job,6,59,Let there be no injustice.
Job,6,60,"Yes, return again."
Job,6,61,My cause is righteous.
Job,6,62,Is there injustice on my tongue?
Job,6,63,Can’t my taste discern mischievous things?
Job,6,64,
Job,7,1,“Isn’t a man forced to labor on earth?
Job,7,2,Aren’t his days like the days of a hired hand?
Job,7,3,"As a servant who earnestly desires the shadow,"
Job,7,4,"as a hireling who looks for his wages,"
Job,7,5,"so am I made to possess months of misery,"
Job,7,6,wearisome nights are appointed to me.
Job,7,7,"When I lie down, I say,"
Job,7,8,"‘When shall I arise, and the night be gone?’"
Job,7,9,I toss and turn until the dawning of the day.
Job,7,10,My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust.
Job,7,11,"My skin closes up, and breaks out afresh."
Job,7,12,"My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle,"
Job,7,13,and are spent without hope.
Job,7,14,Oh remember that my life is a breath.
Job,7,15,My eye shall no more see good.
Job,7,16,The eye of him who sees me shall see me no more.
Job,7,17,"Your eyes shall be on me, but I shall not be."
Job,7,18,"As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away,"
Job,7,19,so he who goes down to Sheol shall come up no more.
Job,7,20,"He shall return no more to his house,"
Job,7,21,neither shall his place know him any more.
Job,7,22,“Therefore I will not keep silent.
Job,7,23,I will speak in the anguish of my spirit.
Job,7,24,I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
Job,7,25,"Am I a sea, or a sea monster,"
Job,7,26,that you put a guard over me?
Job,7,27,"When I say, ‘My bed shall comfort me."
Job,7,28,My couch shall ease my complaint;’
Job,7,29,"then you scare me with dreams,"
Job,7,30,and terrify me through visions:
Job,7,31,"so that my soul chooses strangling,"
Job,7,32,death rather than my bones.
Job,7,33,I loathe my life.
Job,7,34,I don’t want to live forever.
Job,7,35,"Leave me alone, for my days are but a breath."
Job,7,36,"What is man, that you should magnify him,"
Job,7,37,"that you should set your mind on him,"
Job,7,38,"that you should visit him every morning,"
Job,7,39,and test him every moment?
Job,7,40,"How long will you not look away from me,"
Job,7,41,nor leave me alone until I swallow down my spittle?
Job,7,42,"If I have sinned, what do I do to you, you watcher of men?"
Job,7,43,"Why have you set me as a mark for you,"
Job,7,44,so that I am a burden to myself?
Job,7,45,"Why do you not pardon my disobedience, and take away my iniquity?"
Job,7,46,For now shall I lie down in the dust.
Job,7,47,"You will seek me diligently, but I shall not be.”"
Job,7,48,
Job,8,1,"Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,"
Job,8,2,“How long will you speak these things?
Job,8,3,Shall the words of your mouth be a mighty wind?
Job,8,4,Does God pervert justice?
Job,8,5,Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness?
Job,8,6,"If your children have sinned against him,"
Job,8,7,He has delivered them into the hand of their disobedience.
Job,8,8,"If you want to seek God diligently,"
Job,8,9,make your supplication to the Almighty.
Job,8,10,"If you were pure and upright,"
Job,8,11,"surely now he would awaken for you,"
Job,8,12,and make the habitation of your righteousness prosperous.
Job,8,13,"Though your beginning was small,"
Job,8,14,yet your latter end would greatly increase.
Job,8,15,“Please inquire of past generations.
Job,8,16,Find out about the learning of their fathers.
Job,8,17,"(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing,"
Job,8,18,because our days on earth are a shadow.)
Job,8,19,"Shall they not teach you, tell you,"
Job,8,20,and utter words out of their heart?
Job,8,21,“Can the papyrus grow up without mire?
Job,8,22,Can the rushes grow without water?
Job,8,23,"While it is yet in its greenness, not cut down,"
Job,8,24,it withers before any other reed.
Job,8,25,So are the paths of all who forget God.
Job,8,26,"The hope of the godless man shall perish,"
Job,8,27,"Whose confidence shall break apart,"
Job,8,28,Whose trust is a spider’s web.
Job,8,29,"He shall lean on his house, but it shall not stand."
Job,8,30,"He shall cling to it, but it shall not endure."
Job,8,31,He is green before the sun.
Job,8,32,His shoots go out along his garden.
Job,8,33,His roots are wrapped around the rock pile.
Job,8,34,He sees the place of stones.
Job,8,35,"If he is destroyed from his place,"
Job,8,36,"then it shall deny him, saying, ‘I have not seen you.’"
Job,8,37,"Behold, this is the joy of his way:"
Job,8,38,"out of the earth, others shall spring."
Job,8,39,"“Behold, God will not cast away a blameless man,"
Job,8,40,neither will he uphold the evildoers.
Job,8,41,"He will still fill your mouth with laughter,"
Job,8,42,your lips with shouting.
Job,8,43,Those who hate you shall be clothed with shame.
Job,8,44,The tent of the wicked shall be no more.”
Job,8,45,
Job,9,1,"Then Job answered,"
Job,9,2,"“Truly I know that it is so,"
Job,9,3,but how can man be just with God?
Job,9,4,"If he is pleased to contend with him,"
Job,9,5,he can’t answer him one time in a thousand.
Job,9,6,"God who is wise in heart, and mighty in strength:"
Job,9,7,"who has hardened himself against him, and prospered?"
Job,9,8,"He removes the mountains, and they don’t know it,"
Job,9,9,when he overturns them in his anger.
Job,9,10,He shakes the earth out of its place.
Job,9,11,Its pillars tremble.
Job,9,12,"He commands the sun, and it doesn’t rise,"
Job,9,13,and seals up the stars.
Job,9,14,"He alone stretches out the heavens,"
Job,9,15,and treads on the waves of the sea.
Job,9,16,"He makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades,"
Job,9,17,and the rooms of the south.
Job,9,18,He does great things past finding out;
Job,9,19,"yes, marvelous things without number."
Job,9,20,"Behold, he goes by me, and I don’t see him."
Job,9,21,"He passes on also, but I don’t perceive him."
Job,9,22,"Behold, he snatches away."
Job,9,23,Who can hinder him?
Job,9,24,"Who will ask him, ‘What are you doing?’"
Job,9,25,“God will not withdraw his anger.
Job,9,26,The helpers of Rahab stoop under him.
Job,9,27,"How much less shall I answer him,"
Job,9,28,And choose my words to argue with him?
Job,9,29,"Though I were righteous, yet I wouldn’t answer him."
Job,9,30,I would make supplication to my judge.
Job,9,31,"If I had called, and he had answered me,"
Job,9,32,yet I wouldn’t believe that he listened to my voice.
Job,9,33,"For he breaks me with a storm,"
Job,9,34,and multiplies my wounds without cause.
Job,9,35,"He will not allow me to catch my breath,"
Job,9,36,but fills me with bitterness.
Job,9,37,"If it is a matter of strength, behold, he is mighty!"
Job,9,38,"If of justice, ‘Who,’ says he, ‘will summon me?’"
Job,9,39,"Though I am righteous, my own mouth shall condemn me."
Job,9,40,"Though I am blameless, it shall prove me perverse."
Job,9,41,I am blameless.
Job,9,42,I don’t respect myself.
Job,9,43,I despise my life.
Job,9,44,“It is all the same.
Job,9,45,Therefore I say he destroys the blameless and the wicked.
Job,9,46,"If the scourge kills suddenly,"
Job,9,47,he will mock at the trial of the innocent.
Job,9,48,The earth is given into the hand of the wicked.
Job,9,49,He covers the faces of its judges.
Job,9,50,"If not he, then who is it?"
Job,9,51,“Now my days are swifter than a runner.
Job,9,52,"They flee away, they see no good."
Job,9,53,"They have passed away as the swift ships,"
Job,9,54,as the eagle that swoops on the prey.
Job,9,55,"If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint,"
Job,9,56,"I will put off my sad face, and cheer up;’"
Job,9,57,"I am afraid of all my sorrows,"
Job,9,58,I know that you will not hold me innocent.
Job,9,59,I shall be condemned.
Job,9,60,Why then do I labor in vain?
Job,9,61,"If I wash myself with snow,"
Job,9,62,"and cleanse my hands with lye,"
Job,9,63,yet you will plunge me in the ditch.
Job,9,64,My own clothes shall abhor me.
Job,9,65,"For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him,"
Job,9,66,that we should come together in judgment.
Job,9,67,"There is no umpire between us,"
Job,9,68,that might lay his hand on us both.
Job,9,69,Let him take his rod away from me.
Job,9,70,Let his terror not make me afraid;
Job,9,71,"then I would speak, and not fear him,"
Job,9,72,for I am not so in myself.
Job,9,73,
Job,10,1,“My soul is weary of my life.
Job,10,2,I will give free course to my complaint.
Job,10,3,I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
Job,10,4,"I will tell God, ‘Do not condemn me."
Job,10,5,Show me why you contend with me.
Job,10,6,"Is it good to you that you should oppress,"
Job,10,7,"that you should despise the work of your hands,"
Job,10,8,and smile on the counsel of the wicked?
Job,10,9,Do you have eyes of flesh?
Job,10,10,Or do you see as man sees?
Job,10,11,"Are your days as the days of mortals,"
Job,10,12,"or your years as man’s years,"
Job,10,13,"that you inquire after my iniquity,"
Job,10,14,and search after my sin?
Job,10,15,"Although you know that I am not wicked,"
Job,10,16,there is no one who can deliver out of your hand.
Job,10,17,"“‘Your hands have framed me and fashioned me altogether,"
Job,10,18,yet you destroy me.
Job,10,19,"Remember, I beg you, that you have fashioned me as clay."
Job,10,20,Will you bring me into dust again?
Job,10,21,"Haven’t you poured me out like milk,"
Job,10,22,and curdled me like cheese?
Job,10,23,"You have clothed me with skin and flesh,"
Job,10,24,and knit me together with bones and sinews.
Job,10,25,You have granted me life and loving kindness.
Job,10,26,Your visitation has preserved my spirit.
Job,10,27,Yet you hid these things in your heart.
Job,10,28,I know that this is with you:
Job,10,29,"if I sin, then you mark me."
Job,10,30,You will not acquit me from my iniquity.
Job,10,31,"If I am wicked, woe to me."
Job,10,32,"If I am righteous, I still shall not lift up my head,"
Job,10,33,"being filled with disgrace,"
Job,10,34,and conscious of my affliction.
Job,10,35,"If my head is held high, you hunt me like a lion."
Job,10,36,Again you show yourself powerful to me.
Job,10,37,"You renew your witnesses against me,"
Job,10,38,and increase your indignation on me.
Job,10,39,Changes and warfare are with me.
Job,10,40,"“‘Why, then, have you brought me out of the womb?"
Job,10,41,"I wish I had given up the spirit, and no eye had seen me."
Job,10,42,I should have been as though I had not been.
Job,10,43,I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
Job,10,44,Aren’t my days few?
Job,10,45,Cease then.
Job,10,46,"Leave me alone, that I may find a little comfort,"
Job,10,47,"before I go where I shall not return from,"
Job,10,48,to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death;
Job,10,49,"the land dark as midnight,"
Job,10,50,"of the shadow of death,"
Job,10,51,"without any order,"
Job,10,52,where the light is as midnight.’”
Job,10,53,
Job,11,1,"Then Zophar, the Naamathite, answered,"
Job,11,2,“Shouldn’t the multitude of words be answered?
Job,11,3,Should a man full of talk be justified?
Job,11,4,Should your boastings make men hold their peace?
Job,11,5,"When you mock, shall no man make you ashamed?"
Job,11,6,"For you say, ‘My doctrine is pure."
Job,11,7,I am clean in your eyes.’
Job,11,8,"But oh that God would speak,"
Job,11,9,"and open his lips against you,"
Job,11,10,that he would show you the secrets of wisdom!
Job,11,11,For true wisdom has two sides.
Job,11,12,Know therefore that God exacts of you less than your iniquity deserves.
Job,11,13,“Can you fathom the mystery of God?
Job,11,14,Or can you probe the limits of the Almighty?
Job,11,15,They are high as heaven. What can you do?
Job,11,16,They are deeper than Sheol. What can you know?
Job,11,17,"Its measure is longer than the earth,"
Job,11,18,and broader than the sea.
Job,11,19,"If he passes by, or confines,"
Job,11,20,"or convenes a court, then who can oppose him?"
Job,11,21,For he knows false men.
Job,11,22,"He sees iniquity also, even though he doesn’t consider it."
Job,11,23,An empty-headed man becomes wise
Job,11,24,when a man is born as a wild donkey’s colt.
Job,11,25,"“If you set your heart aright,"
Job,11,26,stretch out your hands toward him.
Job,11,27,"If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away."
Job,11,28,Don’t let unrighteousness dwell in your tents.
Job,11,29,Surely then you shall lift up your face without spot;
Job,11,30,"Yes, you shall be steadfast, and shall not fear:"
Job,11,31,for you shall forget your misery.
Job,11,32,You shall remember it like waters that have passed away.
Job,11,33,Life shall be clearer than the noonday.
Job,11,34,"Though there is darkness, it shall be as the morning."
Job,11,35,"You shall be secure, because there is hope."
Job,11,36,"Yes, you shall search, and shall take your rest in safety."
Job,11,37,"Also you shall lie down, and no one shall make you afraid."
Job,11,38,"Yes, many shall court your favor."
Job,11,39,But the eyes of the wicked shall fail.
Job,11,40,They shall have no way to flee.
Job,11,41,Their hope shall be the giving up of the spirit.”
Job,11,42,
Job,12,1,"Then Job answered,"
Job,12,2,"“No doubt, but you are the people,"
Job,12,3,and wisdom shall die with you.
Job,12,4,But I have understanding as well as you;
Job,12,5,I am not inferior to you.
Job,12,6,"Yes, who doesn’t know such things as these?"
Job,12,7,"I am like one who is a joke to his neighbor,"
Job,12,8,"I, who called on God, and he answered."
Job,12,9,"The just, the blameless man is a joke."
Job,12,10,In the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune.
Job,12,11,It is ready for them whose foot slips.
Job,12,12,The tents of robbers prosper.
Job,12,13,"Those who provoke God are secure,"
Job,12,14,who carry their God in their hands.
Job,12,15,"“But ask the animals, now, and they shall teach you;"
Job,12,16,"the birds of the sky, and they shall tell you."
Job,12,17,"Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach you."
Job,12,18,The fish of the sea shall declare to you.
Job,12,19,"Who doesn’t know that in all these,"
Job,12,20,"Yahweh’s hand has done this,"
Job,12,21,"in whose hand is the life of every living thing,"
Job,12,22,and the breath of all mankind?
Job,12,23,"Doesn’t the ear try words,"
Job,12,24,even as the palate tastes its food?
Job,12,25,"With aged men is wisdom,"
Job,12,26,in length of days understanding.
Job,12,27,“With God is wisdom and might.
Job,12,28,He has counsel and understanding.
Job,12,29,"Behold, he breaks down, and it can’t be built again."
Job,12,30,"He imprisons a man, and there can be no release."
Job,12,31,"Behold, he withholds the waters, and they dry up."
Job,12,32,"Again, he sends them out, and they overturn the earth."
Job,12,33,With him is strength and wisdom.
Job,12,34,The deceived and the deceiver are his.
Job,12,35,He leads counselors away stripped.
Job,12,36,He makes judges fools.
Job,12,37,He loosens the bond of kings.
Job,12,38,He binds their waist with a belt.
Job,12,39,"He leads priests away stripped,"
Job,12,40,and overthrows the mighty.
Job,12,41,"He removes the speech of those who are trusted,"
Job,12,42,and takes away the understanding of the elders.
Job,12,43,"He pours contempt on princes,"
Job,12,44,and loosens the belt of the strong.
Job,12,45,"He uncovers deep things out of darkness,"
Job,12,46,and brings out to light the shadow of death.
Job,12,47,"He increases the nations, and he destroys them."
Job,12,48,"He enlarges the nations, and he leads them captive."
Job,12,49,"He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth,"
Job,12,50,and causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.
Job,12,51,They grope in the dark without light.
Job,12,52,He makes them stagger like a drunken man.
Job,12,53,
Job,13,1,"“Behold, my eye has seen all this."
Job,13,2,My ear has heard and understood it.
Job,13,3,"What you know, I know also."
Job,13,4,I am not inferior to you.
Job,13,5,“Surely I would speak to the Almighty.
Job,13,6,I desire to reason with God.
Job,13,7,But you are forgers of lies.
Job,13,8,You are all physicians of no value.
Job,13,9,Oh that you would be completely silent!
Job,13,10,Then you would be wise.
Job,13,11,Hear now my reasoning.
Job,13,12,Listen to the pleadings of my lips.
Job,13,13,"Will you speak unrighteously for God,"
Job,13,14,and talk deceitfully for him?
Job,13,15,Will you show partiality to him?
Job,13,16,Will you contend for God?
Job,13,17,Is it good that he should search you out?
Job,13,18,"Or as one deceives a man, will you deceive him?"
Job,13,19,"He will surely reprove you,"
Job,13,20,if you secretly show partiality.
Job,13,21,"Shall not his majesty make you afraid,"
Job,13,22,And his dread fall on you?
Job,13,23,"Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes,"
Job,13,24,Your defenses are defenses of clay.
Job,13,25,"“Be silent, leave me alone, that I may speak."
Job,13,26,Let come on me what will.
Job,13,27,"Why should I take my flesh in my teeth,"
Job,13,28,and put my life in my hand?
Job,13,29,"Behold, he will kill me."
Job,13,30,I have no hope.
Job,13,31,"Nevertheless, I will maintain my ways before him."
Job,13,32,"This also shall be my salvation,"
Job,13,33,that a godless man shall not come before him.
Job,13,34,Hear diligently my speech.
Job,13,35,Let my declaration be in your ears.
Job,13,36,"See now, I have set my cause in order."
Job,13,37,I know that I am righteous.
Job,13,38,Who is he who will contend with me?
Job,13,39,For then would I hold my peace and give up the spirit.
Job,13,40,“Only don’t do two things to me;
Job,13,41,then I will not hide myself from your face:
Job,13,42,withdraw your hand far from me;
Job,13,43,and don’t let your terror make me afraid.
Job,13,44,"Then call, and I will answer;"
Job,13,45,"or let me speak, and you answer me."
Job,13,46,How many are my iniquities and sins?
Job,13,47,Make me know my disobedience and my sin.
Job,13,48,"Why hide you your face,"
Job,13,49,and hold me for your enemy?
Job,13,50,Will you harass a driven leaf?
Job,13,51,Will you pursue the dry stubble?
Job,13,52,"For you write bitter things against me,"
Job,13,53,and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth:
Job,13,54,"You also put my feet in the stocks,"
Job,13,55,and mark all my paths.
Job,13,56,"You set a bound to the soles of my feet,"
Job,13,57,"though I am decaying like a rotten thing,"
Job,13,58,like a garment that is moth-eaten.
Job,13,59,
Job,14,1,"“Man, who is born of a woman,"
Job,14,2,"is of few days, and full of trouble."
Job,14,3,"He grows up like a flower, and is cut down."
Job,14,4,"He also flees like a shadow, and doesn’t continue."
Job,14,5,"Do you open your eyes on such a one,"
Job,14,6,and bring me into judgment with you?
Job,14,7,Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?
Job,14,8,Not one.
Job,14,9,"Seeing his days are determined,"
Job,14,10,"the number of his months is with you,"
Job,14,11,and you have appointed his bounds that he can’t pass;
Job,14,12,"Look away from him, that he may rest,"
Job,14,13,"until he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day."
Job,14,14,"“For there is hope for a tree,"
Job,14,15,"If it is cut down, that it will sprout again,"
Job,14,16,that the tender branch of it will not cease.
Job,14,17,"Though its root grows old in the earth,"
Job,14,18,"and its stock dies in the ground,"
Job,14,19,"yet through the scent of water it will bud,"
Job,14,20,and sprout boughs like a plant.
Job,14,21,"But man dies, and is laid low."
Job,14,22,"Yes, man gives up the spirit, and where is he?"
Job,14,23,"As the waters fail from the sea,"
Job,14,24,"and the river wastes and dries up,"
Job,14,25,so man lies down and doesn’t rise.
Job,14,26,"Until the heavens are no more, they shall not awake,"
Job,14,27,nor be roused out of their sleep.
Job,14,28,"“Oh that you would hide me in Sheol,"
Job,14,29,"that you would keep me secret, until your wrath is past,"
Job,14,30,"that you would appoint me a set time, and remember me!"
Job,14,31,"If a man dies, shall he live again?"
Job,14,32,"All the days of my warfare would I wait,"
Job,14,33,until my release should come.
Job,14,34,"You would call, and I would answer you."
Job,14,35,You would have a desire to the work of your hands.
Job,14,36,But now you count my steps.
Job,14,37,Don’t you watch over my sin?
Job,14,38,My disobedience is sealed up in a bag.
Job,14,39,You fasten up my iniquity.
Job,14,40,“But the mountain falling comes to nothing.
Job,14,41,The rock is removed out of its place;
Job,14,42,The waters wear the stones.
Job,14,43,The torrents of it wash away the dust of the earth.
Job,14,44,So you destroy the hope of man.
Job,14,45,"You forever prevail against him, and he departs."
Job,14,46,"You change his face, and send him away."
Job,14,47,"His sons come to honor, and he doesn’t know it."
Job,14,48,"They are brought low, but he doesn’t perceive it of them."
Job,14,49,"But his flesh on him has pain,"
Job,14,50,and his soul within him mourns.”
Job,14,51,
Job,15,1,"Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,"
Job,15,2,"“Should a wise man answer with vain knowledge,"
Job,15,3,and fill himself with the east wind?
Job,15,4,"Should he reason with unprofitable talk,"
Job,15,5,or with speeches with which he can do no good?
Job,15,6,"Yes, you do away with fear,"
Job,15,7,and hinder devotion before God.
Job,15,8,"For your iniquity teaches your mouth,"
Job,15,9,and you choose the language of the crafty.
Job,15,10,"Your own mouth condemns you, and not I."
Job,15,11,"Yes, your own lips testify against you."
Job,15,12,“Are you the first man who was born?
Job,15,13,Or were you brought out before the hills?
Job,15,14,Have you heard the secret counsel of God?
Job,15,15,Do you limit wisdom to yourself?
Job,15,16,"What do you know, that we don’t know?"
Job,15,17,"What do you understand, which is not in us?"
Job,15,18,"With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men,"
Job,15,19,much elder than your father.
Job,15,20,"Are the consolations of God too small for you,"
Job,15,21,even the word that is gentle toward you?
Job,15,22,Why does your heart carry you away?
Job,15,23,"Why do your eyes flash,"
Job,15,24,"That you turn your spirit against God,"
Job,15,25,and let such words go out of your mouth?
Job,15,26,"What is man, that he should be clean?"
Job,15,27,"What is he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?"
Job,15,28,"Behold, he puts no trust in his holy ones."
Job,15,29,"Yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight;"
Job,15,30,"how much less one who is abominable and corrupt,"
Job,15,31,a man who drinks iniquity like water!
Job,15,32,"“I will show you, listen to me;"
Job,15,33,that which I have seen I will declare
Job,15,34,"(which wise men have told by their fathers,"
Job,15,35,and have not hidden it;
Job,15,36,"to whom alone the land was given,"
Job,15,37,and no stranger passed among them):
Job,15,38,"the wicked man writhes in pain all his days,"
Job,15,39,even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor.
Job,15,40,A sound of terrors is in his ears.
Job,15,41,In prosperity the destroyer shall come on him.
Job,15,42,He doesn’t believe that he shall return out of darkness.
Job,15,43,He is waited for by the sword.
Job,15,44,"He wanders abroad for bread, saying, ‘Where is it?’"
Job,15,45,He knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.
Job,15,46,Distress and anguish make him afraid.
Job,15,47,"They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle."
Job,15,48,"Because he has stretched out his hand against God,"
Job,15,49,and behaves himself proudly against the Almighty;
Job,15,50,"he runs at him with a stiff neck,"
Job,15,51,with the thick shields of his bucklers;
Job,15,52,"because he has covered his face with his fatness,"
Job,15,53,and gathered fat on his thighs.
Job,15,54,"He has lived in desolate cities,"
Job,15,55,"in houses which no one inhabited,"
Job,15,56,which were ready to become heaps.
Job,15,57,"He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue,"
Job,15,58,neither shall their possessions be extended on the earth.
Job,15,59,He shall not depart out of darkness.
Job,15,60,The flame shall dry up his branches.
Job,15,61,By the breath of God’s mouth shall he go away.
Job,15,62,"Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself;"
Job,15,63,for emptiness shall be his reward.
Job,15,64,It shall be accomplished before his time.
Job,15,65,His branch shall not be green.
Job,15,66,"He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine,"
Job,15,67,and shall cast off his flower as the olive tree.
Job,15,68,"For the company of the godless shall be barren,"
Job,15,69,and fire shall consume the tents of bribery.
Job,15,70,"They conceive mischief, and produce iniquity."
Job,15,71,Their heart prepares deceit.”
Job,15,72,
Job,16,1,"Then Job answered,"
Job,16,2,“I have heard many such things.
Job,16,3,You are all miserable comforters!
Job,16,4,Shall vain words have an end?
Job,16,5,Or what provokes you that you answer?
Job,16,6,I also could speak as you do.
Job,16,7,"If your soul were in my soul’s place,"
Job,16,8,"I could join words together against you,"
Job,16,9,"and shake my head at you,"
Job,16,10,but I would strengthen you with my mouth.
Job,16,11,The solace of my lips would relieve you.
Job,16,12,"“Though I speak, my grief is not subsided."
Job,16,13,"Though I forbear, what am I eased?"
Job,16,14,"But now, God, you have surely worn me out."
Job,16,15,You have made desolate all my company.
Job,16,16,You have shriveled me up. This is a witness against me.
Job,16,17,My leanness rises up against me.
Job,16,18,It testifies to my face.
Job,16,19,"He has torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me."
Job,16,20,He has gnashed on me with his teeth.
Job,16,21,My adversary sharpens his eyes on me.
Job,16,22,They have gaped on me with their mouth.
Job,16,23,They have struck me on the cheek reproachfully.
Job,16,24,They gather themselves together against me.
Job,16,25,"God delivers me to the ungodly,"
Job,16,26,and casts me into the hands of the wicked.
Job,16,27,"I was at ease, and he broke me apart."
Job,16,28,"Yes, he has taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces."
Job,16,29,He has also set me up for his target.
Job,16,30,His archers surround me.
Job,16,31,"He splits my kidneys apart, and does not spare."
Job,16,32,He pours out my gall on the ground.
Job,16,33,He breaks me with breach on breach.
Job,16,34,He runs on me like a giant.
Job,16,35,"I have sewed sackcloth on my skin,"
Job,16,36,and have thrust my horn in the dust.
Job,16,37,My face is red with weeping.
Job,16,38,Deep darkness is on my eyelids.
Job,16,39,"Although there is no violence in my hands,"
Job,16,40,and my prayer is pure.
Job,16,41,"“Earth, don’t cover my blood."
Job,16,42,Let my cry have no place to rest.
Job,16,43,"Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven."
Job,16,44,He who vouches for me is on high.
Job,16,45,My friends scoff at me.
Job,16,46,"My eyes pour out tears to God,"
Job,16,47,"that he would maintain the right of a man with God,"
Job,16,48,of a son of man with his neighbor!
Job,16,49,"For when a few years have come,"
Job,16,50,I shall go the way of no return.
Job,16,51,
Job,17,1,“My spirit is consumed.
Job,17,2,"My days are extinct,"
Job,17,3,And the grave is ready for me.
Job,17,4,Surely there are mockers with me.
Job,17,5,My eye dwells on their provocation.
Job,17,6,"“Now give a pledge, be collateral for me with yourself."
Job,17,7,Who is there who will strike hands with me?
Job,17,8,"For you have hidden their heart from understanding,"
Job,17,9,Therefore you shall not exalt them.
Job,17,10,"He who denounces his friends for plunder,"
Job,17,11,Even the eyes of his children shall fail.
Job,17,12,“But he has made me a byword of the people.
Job,17,13,They spit in my face.
Job,17,14,My eye also is dim by reason of sorrow.
Job,17,15,All my members are as a shadow.
Job,17,16,Upright men shall be astonished at this.
Job,17,17,The innocent shall stir up himself against the godless.
Job,17,18,Yet shall the righteous hold on his way.
Job,17,19,He who has clean hands shall grow stronger and stronger.
Job,17,20,"But as for you all, come on now again;"
Job,17,21,I shall not find a wise man among you.
Job,17,22,"My days are past, my plans are broken off,"
Job,17,23,as are the thoughts of my heart.
Job,17,24,"They change the night into day,"
Job,17,25,saying ‘The light is near’ in the presence of darkness.
Job,17,26,"If I look for Sheol as my house,"
Job,17,27,"if I have spread my couch in the darkness,"
Job,17,28,"If I have said to corruption, ‘You are my father;’"
Job,17,29,"to the worm, ‘My mother,’ and ‘my sister;’"
Job,17,30,where then is my hope?
Job,17,31,"as for my hope, who shall see it?"
Job,17,32,"Shall it go down with me to the gates of Sheol,"
Job,17,33,or descend together into the dust?”
Job,17,34,
Job,18,1,"Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,"
Job,18,2,“How long will you hunt for words?
Job,18,3,"Consider, and afterwards we will speak."
Job,18,4,"Why are we counted as animals,"
Job,18,5,which have become unclean in your sight?
Job,18,6,"You who tear yourself in your anger,"
Job,18,7,shall the earth be forsaken for you?
Job,18,8,Or shall the rock be removed out of its place?
Job,18,9,"“Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out,"
Job,18,10,The spark of his fire shall not shine.
Job,18,11,The light shall be dark in his tent.
Job,18,12,His lamp above him shall be put out.
Job,18,13,The steps of his strength shall be shortened.
Job,18,14,His own counsel shall cast him down.
Job,18,15,"For he is cast into a net by his own feet,"
Job,18,16,and he wanders into its mesh.
Job,18,17,A snare will take him by the heel.
Job,18,18,A trap will catch him.
Job,18,19,"A noose is hidden for him in the ground,"
Job,18,20,a trap for him on the path.
Job,18,21,"Terrors shall make him afraid on every side,"
Job,18,22,and shall chase him at his heels.
Job,18,23,His strength shall be famished.
Job,18,24,Calamity shall be ready at his side.
Job,18,25,The members of his body shall be devoured.
Job,18,26,The firstborn of death shall devour his members.
Job,18,27,He shall be rooted out of the security of his tent.
Job,18,28,He shall be brought to the king of terrors.
Job,18,29,There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his.
Job,18,30,Sulfur shall be scattered on his habitation.
Job,18,31,His roots shall be dried up beneath.
Job,18,32,Above shall his branch be cut off.
Job,18,33,His memory shall perish from the earth.
Job,18,34,He shall have no name in the street.
Job,18,35,"He shall be driven from light into darkness,"
Job,18,36,and chased out of the world.
Job,18,37,"He shall have neither son nor grandson among his people,"
Job,18,38,nor any remaining where he lived.
Job,18,39,"Those who come after shall be astonished at his day,"
Job,18,40,as those who went before were frightened.
Job,18,41,Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous.
Job,18,42,This is the place of him who doesn’t know God.”
Job,18,43,
Job,20,1,"Then Zophar the Naamathite answered,"
Job,20,2,"“Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me,"
Job,20,3,even by reason of my haste that is in me.
Job,20,4,I have heard the reproof which puts me to shame.
Job,20,5,The spirit of my understanding answers me.
Job,20,6,"Don’t you know this from old time,"
Job,20,7,"since man was placed on earth,"
Job,20,8,"that the triumphing of the wicked is short,"
Job,20,9,the joy of the godless but for a moment?
Job,20,10,"Though his height mount up to the heavens,"
Job,20,11,"and his head reach to the clouds,"
Job,20,12,yet he shall perish forever like his own dung.
Job,20,13,"Those who have seen him shall say, ‘Where is he?’"
Job,20,14,"He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found."
Job,20,15,"Yes, he shall be chased away like a vision of the night."
Job,20,16,"The eye which saw him shall see him no more,"
Job,20,17,neither shall his place any more see him.
Job,20,18,His children shall seek the favor of the poor.
Job,20,19,His hands shall give back his wealth.
Job,20,20,"His bones are full of his youth,"
Job,20,21,but youth shall lie down with him in the dust.
Job,20,22,"“Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth,"
Job,20,23,"though he hide it under his tongue,"
Job,20,24,"though he spare it, and will not let it go,"
Job,20,25,but keep it still within his mouth;
Job,20,26,yet his food in his bowels is turned.
Job,20,27,It is cobra venom within him.
Job,20,28,"He has swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again."
Job,20,29,God will cast them out of his belly.
Job,20,30,He shall suck cobra venom.
Job,20,31,The viper’s tongue shall kill him.
Job,20,32,"He shall not look at the rivers,"
Job,20,33,the flowing streams of honey and butter.
Job,20,34,"That for which he labored he shall restore, and shall not swallow it down."
Job,20,35,"According to the substance that he has gotten, he shall not rejoice."
Job,20,36,For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor.
Job,20,37,"He has violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up."
Job,20,38,"“Because he knew no quietness within him,"
Job,20,39,he shall not save anything of that in which he delights.
Job,20,40,"There was nothing left that he didn’t devour,"
Job,20,41,therefore his prosperity shall not endure.
Job,20,42,"In the fullness of his sufficiency, distress shall overtake him."
Job,20,43,The hand of everyone who is in misery shall come on him.
Job,20,44,"When he is about to fill his belly, God will cast the fierceness of his wrath on him."
Job,20,45,It will rain on him while he is eating.
Job,20,46,He shall flee from the iron weapon.
Job,20,47,The bronze arrow shall strike him through.
Job,20,48,"He draws it out, and it comes out of his body."
Job,20,49,"Yes, the glittering point comes out of his liver."
Job,20,50,Terrors are on him.
Job,20,51,All darkness is laid up for his treasures.
Job,20,52,An unfanned fire shall devour him.
Job,20,53,It shall consume that which is left in his tent.
Job,20,54,The heavens shall reveal his iniquity.
Job,20,55,The earth shall rise up against him.
Job,20,56,The increase of his house shall depart.
Job,20,57,They shall rush away in the day of his wrath.
Job,20,58,"This is the portion of a wicked man from God,"
Job,20,59,the heritage appointed to him by God.”
Job,20,60,
Job,21,1,"Then Job answered,"
Job,21,2,“Listen diligently to my speech.
Job,21,3,Let this be your consolation.
Job,21,4,"Allow me, and I also will speak;"
Job,21,5,"After I have spoken, mock on."
Job,21,6,"As for me, is my complaint to man?"
Job,21,7,Why shouldn’t I be impatient?
Job,21,8,"Look at me, and be astonished."
Job,21,9,Lay your hand on your mouth.
Job,21,10,"When I remember, I am troubled."
Job,21,11,Horror takes hold of my flesh.
Job,21,12,"“Why do the wicked live,"
Job,21,13,"become old, yes, and grow mighty in power?"
Job,21,14,"Their child is established with them in their sight,"
Job,21,15,their offspring before their eyes.
Job,21,16,"Their houses are safe from fear,"
Job,21,17,neither is the rod of God upon them.
Job,21,18,Their bulls breed without fail.
Job,21,19,"Their cows calve, and don’t miscarry."
Job,21,20,They send out their little ones like a flock.
Job,21,21,Their children dance.
Job,21,22,"They sing to the tambourine and harp,"
Job,21,23,and rejoice at the sound of the pipe.
Job,21,24,They spend their days in prosperity.
Job,21,25,In an instant they go down to Sheol.
Job,21,26,"They tell God, ‘Depart from us,"
Job,21,27,for we don’t want to know about your ways.
Job,21,28,"What is the Almighty, that we should serve him?"
Job,21,29,"What profit should we have, if we pray to him?’"
Job,21,30,"Behold, their prosperity is not in their hand."
Job,21,31,The counsel of the wicked is far from me.
Job,21,32,"“How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out,"
Job,21,33,"that their calamity comes on them,"
Job,21,34,that God distributes sorrows in his anger?
Job,21,35,"How often is it that they are as stubble before the wind,"
Job,21,36,as chaff that the storm carries away?
Job,21,37,"You say, ‘God lays up his iniquity for his children.’"
Job,21,38,"Let him recompense it to himself, that he may know it."
Job,21,39,Let his own eyes see his destruction.
Job,21,40,Let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
Job,21,41,"For what does he care for his house after him,"
Job,21,42,when the number of his months is cut off?
Job,21,43,"“Shall any teach God knowledge,"
Job,21,44,since he judges those who are high?
Job,21,45,"One dies in his full strength,"
Job,21,46,being wholly at ease and quiet.
Job,21,47,His pails are full of milk.
Job,21,48,The marrow of his bones is moistened.
Job,21,49,"Another dies in bitterness of soul,"
Job,21,50,and never tastes of good.
Job,21,51,They lie down alike in the dust.
Job,21,52,The worm covers them.
Job,21,53,"“Behold, I know your thoughts,"
Job,21,54,the plans with which you would wrong me.
Job,21,55,"For you say, ‘Where is the house of the prince?"
Job,21,56,Where is the tent in which the wicked lived?’
Job,21,57,Haven’t you asked wayfaring men?
Job,21,58,"Don’t you know their evidences,"
Job,21,59,"that the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity,"
Job,21,60,That they are led out to the day of wrath?
Job,21,61,Who shall declare his way to his face?
Job,21,62,Who shall repay him what he has done?
Job,21,63,Yet he will be borne to the grave.
Job,21,64,Men shall keep watch over the tomb.
Job,21,65,The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him.
Job,21,66,"All men shall draw after him,"
Job,21,67,as there were innumerable before him.
Job,21,68,"So how can you comfort me with nonsense,"
Job,21,69,because in your answers there remains only falsehood?”
Job,21,70,
Job,22,1,"Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,"
Job,22,2,“Can a man be profitable to God?
Job,22,3,Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself.
Job,22,4,"Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that you are righteous?"
Job,22,5,"Or does it benefit him, that you make your ways perfect?"
Job,22,6,"Is it for your piety that he reproves you,"
Job,22,7,that he enters with you into judgment?
Job,22,8,Isn’t your wickedness great?
Job,22,9,Neither is there any end to your iniquities.
Job,22,10,"For you have taken pledges from your brother for nothing,"
Job,22,11,and stripped the naked of their clothing.
Job,22,12,"You haven’t given water to the weary to drink,"
Job,22,13,and you have withheld bread from the hungry.
Job,22,14,"But as for the mighty man, he had the earth."
Job,22,15,"The honorable man, he lived in it."
Job,22,16,"You have sent widows away empty,"
Job,22,17,and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.
Job,22,18,Therefore snares are around you.
Job,22,19,"Sudden fear troubles you,"
Job,22,20,"or darkness, so that you can not see,"
Job,22,21,and floods of waters cover you.
Job,22,22,“Isn’t God in the heights of heaven?
Job,22,23,"See the height of the stars, how high they are!"
Job,22,24,"You say, ‘What does God know?"
Job,22,25,Can he judge through the thick darkness?
Job,22,26,"Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he doesn’t see."
Job,22,27,He walks on the vault of the sky.’
Job,22,28,"Will you keep the old way,"
Job,22,29,"which wicked men have trodden,"
Job,22,30,"who were snatched away before their time,"
Job,22,31,"whose foundation was poured out as a stream,"
Job,22,32,"who said to God, ‘Depart from us;’"
Job,22,33,"and, ‘What can the Almighty do for us?’"
Job,22,34,"Yet he filled their houses with good things,"
Job,22,35,but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
Job,22,36,"The righteous see it, and are glad."
Job,22,37,"The innocent ridicule them,"
Job,22,38,"saying, ‘Surely those who rose up against us are cut off."
Job,22,39,The fire has consumed their remnant.’
Job,22,40,"“Acquaint yourself with him, now, and be at peace."
Job,22,41,Thereby good shall come to you.
Job,22,42,"Please receive instruction from his mouth,"
Job,22,43,and lay up his words in your heart.
Job,22,44,"If you return to the Almighty, you shall be built up,"
Job,22,45,if you put away unrighteousness far from your tents.
Job,22,46,"Lay your treasure in the dust,"
Job,22,47,the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks.
Job,22,48,"The Almighty will be your treasure,"
Job,22,49,and precious silver to you.
Job,22,50,"For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty,"
Job,22,51,and shall lift up your face to God.
Job,22,52,"You shall make your prayer to him, and he will hear you."
Job,22,53,You shall pay your vows.
Job,22,54,"You shall also decree a thing, and it shall be established to you."
Job,22,55,Light shall shine on your ways.
Job,22,56,"When they cast down, you shall say, ‘be lifted up.’"
Job,22,57,He will save the humble person.
Job,22,58,He will even deliver him who is not innocent.
Job,22,59,"Yes, he shall be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.”"
Job,22,60,
Job,23,1,"Then Job answered,"
Job,23,2,“Even today my complaint is rebellious.
Job,23,3,His hand is heavy in spite of my groaning.
Job,23,4,Oh that I knew where I might find him!
Job,23,5,That I might come even to his seat!
Job,23,6,"I would set my cause in order before him,"
Job,23,7,and fill my mouth with arguments.
Job,23,8,"I would know the words which he would answer me,"
Job,23,9,and understand what he would tell me.
Job,23,10,Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power?
Job,23,11,"No, but he would listen to me."
Job,23,12,"There the upright might reason with him,"
Job,23,13,so I should be delivered forever from my judge.
Job,23,14,"“If I go east, he is not there;"
Job,23,15,"if west, I can’t find him;"
Job,23,16,"He works to the north, but I can’t see him."
Job,23,17,"He turns south, but I can’t catch a glimpse of him."
Job,23,18,But he knows the way that I take.
Job,23,19,"When he has tried me, I shall come out like gold."
Job,23,20,My foot has held fast to his steps.
Job,23,21,"I have kept his way, and not turned away."
Job,23,22,I haven’t gone back from the commandment of his lips.
Job,23,23,I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.
Job,23,24,"But he stands alone, and who can oppose him?"
Job,23,25,"What his soul desires, even that he does."
Job,23,26,For he performs that which is appointed for me.
Job,23,27,Many such things are with him.
Job,23,28,Therefore I am terrified at his presence.
Job,23,29,"When I consider, I am afraid of him."
Job,23,30,For God has made my heart faint.
Job,23,31,The Almighty has terrified me.
Job,23,32,"Because I was not cut off before the darkness,"
Job,23,33,neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face.
Job,23,34,
Job,24,1,“Why aren’t times laid up by the Almighty?
Job,24,2,Why don’t those who know him see his days?
Job,24,3,There are people who remove the landmarks.
Job,24,4,"They violently take away flocks, and feed them."
Job,24,5,"They drive away the donkey of the fatherless,"
Job,24,6,and they take the widow’s ox for a pledge.
Job,24,7,They turn the needy out of the way.
Job,24,8,The poor of the earth all hide themselves.
Job,24,9,"Behold, as wild donkeys in the desert,"
Job,24,10,"they go out to their work, seeking diligently for food."
Job,24,11,The wilderness yields them bread for their children.
Job,24,12,They cut their food in the field.
Job,24,13,They glean the vineyard of the wicked.
Job,24,14,"They lie all night naked without clothing,"
Job,24,15,and have no covering in the cold.
Job,24,16,"They are wet with the showers of the mountains,"
Job,24,17,and embrace the rock for lack of a shelter.
Job,24,18,"There are those who pluck the fatherless from the breast,"
Job,24,19,"and take a pledge of the poor,"
Job,24,20,So that they go around naked without clothing.
Job,24,21,"Being hungry, they carry the sheaves."
Job,24,22,They make oil within the walls of these men.
Job,24,23,"They tread wine presses, and suffer thirst."
Job,24,24,"From out of the populous city, men groan."
Job,24,25,"The soul of the wounded cries out,"
Job,24,26,yet God doesn’t regard the folly.
Job,24,27,“These are of those who rebel against the light.
Job,24,28,"They don’t know its ways,"
Job,24,29,nor stay in its paths.
Job,24,30,The murderer rises with the light.
Job,24,31,He kills the poor and needy.
Job,24,32,In the night he is like a thief.
Job,24,33,"The eye also of the adulterer waits for the twilight,"
Job,24,34,"saying, ‘No eye shall see me.’"
Job,24,35,He disguises his face.
Job,24,36,In the dark they dig through houses.
Job,24,37,They shut themselves up in the daytime.
Job,24,38,They don’t know the light.
Job,24,39,"For the morning is to all of them like thick darkness,"
Job,24,40,for they know the terrors of the thick darkness.
Job,24,41,“They are foam on the surface of the waters.
Job,24,42,Their portion is cursed in the earth.
Job,24,43,They don’t turn into the way of the vineyards.
Job,24,44,"Drought and heat consume the snow waters,"
Job,24,45,so does Sheol those who have sinned.
Job,24,46,The womb shall forget him.
Job,24,47,The worm shall feed sweetly on him.
Job,24,48,He shall be no more remembered.
Job,24,49,Unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree.
Job,24,50,He devours the barren who don’t bear.
Job,24,51,He shows no kindness to the widow.
Job,24,52,Yet God preserves the mighty by his power.
Job,24,53,He rises up who has no assurance of life.
Job,24,54,"God gives them security, and they rest in it."
Job,24,55,His eyes are on their ways.
Job,24,56,"They are exalted; yet a little while, and they are gone."
Job,24,57,"Yes, they are brought low, they are taken out of the way as all others,"
Job,24,58,and are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain.
Job,24,59,"If it isn’t so now, who will prove me a liar,"
Job,24,60,and make my speech worth nothing?”
Job,24,61,
Job,25,1,"Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,"
Job,25,2,“Dominion and fear are with him.
Job,25,3,He makes peace in his high places.
Job,25,4,Can his armies be counted?
Job,25,5,On whom does his light not arise?
Job,25,6,How then can man be just with God?
Job,25,7,Or how can he who is born of a woman be clean?
Job,25,8,"Behold, even the moon has no brightness,"
Job,25,9,and the stars are not pure in his sight;
Job,25,10,"How much less man, who is a worm,"
Job,25,11,"the son of man, who is a worm!”"
Job,25,12,
Job,26,1,"Then Job answered,"
Job,26,2,“How have you helped him who is without power!
Job,26,3,How have you saved the arm that has no strength!
Job,26,4,"How have you counseled him who has no wisdom,"
Job,26,5,and plentifully declared sound knowledge!
Job,26,6,To whom have you uttered words?
Job,26,7,Whose spirit came out of you?
Job,26,8,"“The departed spirits tremble,"
Job,26,9,those beneath the waters and all that live in them.
Job,26,10,"Sheol is naked before God,"
Job,26,11,and Abaddon has no covering.
Job,26,12,"He stretches out the north over empty space,"
Job,26,13,and hangs the earth on nothing.
Job,26,14,"He binds up the waters in his thick clouds,"
Job,26,15,and the cloud is not burst under them.
Job,26,16,"He encloses the face of his throne,"
Job,26,17,and spreads his cloud on it.
Job,26,18,"He has described a boundary on the surface of the waters,"
Job,26,19,and to the confines of light and darkness.
Job,26,20,The pillars of heaven tremble
Job,26,21,and are astonished at his rebuke.
Job,26,22,"He stirs up the sea with his power,"
Job,26,23,and by his understanding he strikes through Rahab.
Job,26,24,By his Spirit the heavens are garnished.
Job,26,25,His hand has pierced the swift serpent.
Job,26,26,"Behold, these are but the outskirts of his ways."
Job,26,27,How small a whisper do we hear of him!
Job,26,28,But the thunder of his power who can understand?”
Job,26,29,
Job,27,1,"Job again took up his parable, and said,"
Job,27,2,"“As God lives, who has taken away my right,"
Job,27,3,"the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter"
Job,27,4,"(for the length of my life is still in me,"
Job,27,5,and the spirit of God is in my nostrils);
Job,27,6,"surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness,"
Job,27,7,neither shall my tongue utter deceit.
Job,27,8,Far be it from me that I should justify you.
Job,27,9,Until I die I will not put away my integrity from me.
Job,27,10,"I hold fast to my righteousness, and will not let it go."
Job,27,11,My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.
Job,27,12,“Let my enemy be as the wicked.
Job,27,13,Let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous.
Job,27,14,"For what is the hope of the godless, when he is cut off, when God takes away his life?"
Job,27,15,Will God hear his cry when trouble comes on him?
Job,27,16,"Will he delight himself in the Almighty,"
Job,27,17,and call on God at all times?
Job,27,18,I will teach you about the hand of God.
Job,27,19,That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.
Job,27,20,"Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves;"
Job,27,21,why then have you become altogether vain?
Job,27,22,"“This is the portion of a wicked man with God,"
Job,27,23,"the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty."
Job,27,24,"If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword."
Job,27,25,His offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
Job,27,26,Those who remain of him shall be buried in death.
Job,27,27,His widows shall make no lamentation.
Job,27,28,"Though he heap up silver as the dust,"
Job,27,29,and prepare clothing as the clay;
Job,27,30,"he may prepare it, but the just shall put it on,"
Job,27,31,and the innocent shall divide the silver.
Job,27,32,"He builds his house as the moth,"
Job,27,33,as a booth which the watchman makes.
Job,27,34,"He lies down rich, but he shall not do so again."
Job,27,35,"He opens his eyes, and he is not."
Job,27,36,Terrors overtake him like waters.
Job,27,37,A storm steals him away in the night.
Job,27,38,"The east wind carries him away, and he departs."
Job,27,39,It sweeps him out of his place.
Job,27,40,"For it hurls at him, and does not spare,"
Job,27,41,as he flees away from his hand.
Job,27,42,"Men shall clap their hands at him,"
Job,27,43,and shall hiss him out of his place.
Job,27,44,
Job,28,1,"“Surely there is a mine for silver,"
Job,28,2,and a place for gold which they refine.
Job,28,3,"Iron is taken out of the earth,"
Job,28,4,and copper is smelted out of the ore.
Job,28,5,"Man sets an end to darkness,"
Job,28,6,"and searches out, to the furthest bound,"
Job,28,7,the stones of obscurity and of thick darkness.
Job,28,8,He breaks open a shaft away from where people live.
Job,28,9,They are forgotten by the foot.
Job,28,10,"They hang far from men, they swing back and forth."
Job,28,11,"As for the earth, out of it comes bread;"
Job,28,12,Underneath it is turned up as it were by fire.
Job,28,13,Sapphires come from its rocks.
Job,28,14,It has dust of gold.
Job,28,15,"That path no bird of prey knows,"
Job,28,16,neither has the falcon’s eye seen it.
Job,28,17,"The proud animals have not trodden it,"
Job,28,18,nor has the fierce lion passed by there.
Job,28,19,"He puts his hand on the flinty rock,"
Job,28,20,and he overturns the mountains by the roots.
Job,28,21,He cuts out channels among the rocks.
Job,28,22,His eye sees every precious thing.
Job,28,23,He binds the streams that they don’t trickle.
Job,28,24,The thing that is hidden he brings out to light.
Job,28,25,“But where shall wisdom be found?
Job,28,26,Where is the place of understanding?
Job,28,27,Man doesn’t know its price;
Job,28,28,Neither is it found in the land of the living.
Job,28,29,"The deep says, ‘It isn’t in me.’"
Job,28,30,"The sea says, ‘It isn’t with me.’"
Job,28,31,"It can’t be gotten for gold,"
Job,28,32,neither shall silver be weighed for its price.
Job,28,33,"It can’t be valued with the gold of Ophir,"
Job,28,34,"with the precious onyx, or the sapphire."
Job,28,35,"Gold and glass can’t equal it,"
Job,28,36,neither shall it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold.
Job,28,37,No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal.
Job,28,38,"Yes, the price of wisdom is above rubies."
Job,28,39,"The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it,"
Job,28,40,Neither shall it be valued with pure gold.
Job,28,41,Where then does wisdom come from?
Job,28,42,Where is the place of understanding?
Job,28,43,"Seeing it is hidden from the eyes of all living,"
Job,28,44,and kept close from the birds of the sky.
Job,28,45,"Destruction and Death say,"
Job,28,46,‘We have heard a rumor of it with our ears.’
Job,28,47,"“God understands its way,"
Job,28,48,and he knows its place.
Job,28,49,"For he looks to the ends of the earth,"
Job,28,50,and sees under the whole sky.
Job,28,51,He establishes the force of the wind.
Job,28,52,"Yes, he measures out the waters by measure."
Job,28,53,"When he made a decree for the rain,"
Job,28,54,and a way for the lightning of the thunder;
Job,28,55,"then he saw it, and declared it."
Job,28,56,"He established it, yes, and searched it out."
Job,28,57,"To man he said,"
Job,28,58,"‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom."
Job,28,59,To depart from evil is understanding.’”
Job,28,60,
Job,29,1,"Job again took up his parable, and said,"
Job,29,2,"“Oh that I were as in the months of old,"
Job,29,3,as in the days when God watched over me;
Job,29,4,"when his lamp shone on my head,"
Job,29,5,"and by his light I walked through darkness,"
Job,29,6,"as I was in the ripeness of my days,"
Job,29,7,"when the friendship of God was in my tent,"
Job,29,8,"when the Almighty was yet with me,"
Job,29,9,"and my children were around me,"
Job,29,10,"when my steps were washed with butter,"
Job,29,11,"and the rock poured out streams of oil for me,"
Job,29,12,"when I went out to the city gate,"
Job,29,13,when I prepared my seat in the street.
Job,29,14,The young men saw me and hid themselves.
Job,29,15,The aged rose up and stood.
Job,29,16,"The princes refrained from talking,"
Job,29,17,and laid their hand on their mouth.
Job,29,18,"The voice of the nobles was hushed,"
Job,29,19,and their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth.
Job,29,20,"For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me;"
Job,29,21,"and when the eye saw me, it commended me:"
Job,29,22,"Because I delivered the poor who cried,"
Job,29,23,"and the fatherless also, who had no one to help him,"
Job,29,24,"the blessing of him who was ready to perish came on me,"
Job,29,25,and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.
Job,29,26,"I put on righteousness, and it clothed me."
Job,29,27,My justice was as a robe and a diadem.
Job,29,28,"I was eyes to the blind,"
Job,29,29,and feet to the lame.
Job,29,30,I was a father to the needy.
Job,29,31,"The cause of him who I didn’t know, I searched out."
Job,29,32,"I broke the jaws of the unrighteous,"
Job,29,33,and plucked the prey out of his teeth.
Job,29,34,"Then I said, ‘I shall die in my own house,"
Job,29,35,I shall count my days as the sand.
Job,29,36,My root is spread out to the waters.
Job,29,37,The dew lies all night on my branch.
Job,29,38,My glory is fresh in me.
Job,29,39,My bow is renewed in my hand.’
Job,29,40,"“Men listened to me, waited,"
Job,29,41,and kept silence for my counsel.
Job,29,42,After my words they didn’t speak again.
Job,29,43,My speech fell on them.
Job,29,44,They waited for me as for the rain.
Job,29,45,Their mouths drank as with the spring rain.
Job,29,46,I smiled on them when they had no confidence.
Job,29,47,They didn’t reject the light of my face.
Job,29,48,"I chose out their way, and sat as chief."
Job,29,49,"I lived as a king in the army,"
Job,29,50,as one who comforts the mourners.
Job,29,51,
Job,30,1,"“But now those who are younger than I have me in derision,"
Job,30,2,whose fathers I would have disdained to put with my sheep dogs.
Job,30,3,"Of what use is the strength of their hands to me,"
Job,30,4,men in whom ripe age has perished?
Job,30,5,They are gaunt from lack and famine.
Job,30,6,"They gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of waste and desolation."
Job,30,7,They pluck salt herbs by the bushes.
Job,30,8,The roots of the broom are their food.
Job,30,9,They are driven out from among men.
Job,30,10,They cry after them as after a thief;
Job,30,11,"So that they dwell in frightful valleys,"
Job,30,12,and in holes of the earth and of the rocks.
Job,30,13,Among the bushes they bray;
Job,30,14,and under the nettles they are gathered together.
Job,30,15,"They are children of fools, yes, children of wicked men."
Job,30,16,They were flogged out of the land.
Job,30,17,“Now I have become their song.
Job,30,18,"Yes, I am a byword to them."
Job,30,19,"They abhor me, they stand aloof from me,"
Job,30,20,and don’t hesitate to spit in my face.
Job,30,21,"For he has untied his cord, and afflicted me;"
Job,30,22,and they have thrown off restraint before me.
Job,30,23,On my right hand rise the rabble.
Job,30,24,"They thrust aside my feet,"
Job,30,25,They cast up against me their ways of destruction.
Job,30,26,"They mar my path,"
Job,30,27,"They set forward my calamity,"
Job,30,28,without anyone’s help.
Job,30,29,"As through a wide breach they come,"
Job,30,30,in the middle of the ruin they roll themselves in.
Job,30,31,Terrors have turned on me.
Job,30,32,They chase my honor as the wind.
Job,30,33,My welfare has passed away as a cloud.
Job,30,34,“Now my soul is poured out within me.
Job,30,35,Days of affliction have taken hold on me.
Job,30,36,"In the night season my bones are pierced in me,"
Job,30,37,and the pains that gnaw me take no rest.
Job,30,38,By great force is my garment disfigured.
Job,30,39,It binds me about as the collar of my coat.
Job,30,40,He has cast me into the mire.
Job,30,41,I have become like dust and ashes.
Job,30,42,"I cry to you, and you do not answer me."
Job,30,43,"I stand up, and you gaze at me."
Job,30,44,You have turned to be cruel to me.
Job,30,45,With the might of your hand you persecute me.
Job,30,46,"You lift me up to the wind, and drive me with it."
Job,30,47,You dissolve me in the storm.
Job,30,48,"For I know that you will bring me to death,"
Job,30,49,To the house appointed for all living.
Job,30,50,“However doesn’t one stretch out a hand in his fall?
Job,30,51,Or in his calamity therefore cry for help?
Job,30,52,Didn’t I weep for him who was in trouble?
Job,30,53,Wasn’t my soul grieved for the needy?
Job,30,54,"When I looked for good, then evil came;"
Job,30,55,"When I waited for light, there came darkness."
Job,30,56,"My heart is troubled, and doesn’t rest."
Job,30,57,Days of affliction have come on me.
Job,30,58,I go mourning without the sun.
Job,30,59,"I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help."
Job,30,60,"I am a brother to jackals,"
Job,30,61,and a companion to ostriches.
Job,30,62,My skin grows black and peels from me.
Job,30,63,My bones are burned with heat.
Job,30,64,"Therefore my harp has turned to mourning,"
Job,30,65,and my pipe into the voice of those who weep.
Job,30,66,
Job,31,1,"“I made a covenant with my eyes,"
Job,31,2,how then should I look lustfully at a young woman?
Job,31,3,"For what is the portion from God above,"
Job,31,4,and the heritage from the Almighty on high?
Job,31,5,"Is it not calamity to the unrighteous,"
Job,31,6,and disaster to the workers of iniquity?
Job,31,7,"Doesn’t he see my ways,"
Job,31,8,and count all my steps?
Job,31,9,"“If I have walked with falsehood,"
Job,31,10,and my foot has hurried to deceit
Job,31,11,"(let me be weighed in an even balance,"
Job,31,12,that God may know my integrity);
Job,31,13,"if my step has turned out of the way,"
Job,31,14,"if my heart walked after my eyes,"
Job,31,15,"if any defilement has stuck to my hands,"
Job,31,16,"then let me sow, and let another eat."
Job,31,17,"Yes, let the produce of my field be rooted out."
Job,31,18,"“If my heart has been enticed to a woman,"
Job,31,19,"and I have laid wait at my neighbor’s door,"
Job,31,20,"then let my wife grind for another,"
Job,31,21,and let others sleep with her.
Job,31,22,For that would be a heinous crime.
Job,31,23,"Yes, it would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges:"
Job,31,24,"For it is a fire that consumes to destruction,"
Job,31,25,and would root out all my increase.
Job,31,26,“If I have despised the cause of my male servant
Job,31,27,"or of my female servant,"
Job,31,28,when they contended with me;
Job,31,29,What then shall I do when God rises up?
Job,31,30,"When he visits, what shall I answer him?"
Job,31,31,Didn’t he who made me in the womb make him?
Job,31,32,Didn’t one fashion us in the womb?
Job,31,33,"“If I have withheld the poor from their desire,"
Job,31,34,"or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,"
Job,31,35,"or have eaten my morsel alone,"
Job,31,36,and the fatherless has not eaten of it
Job,31,37,"(no, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father,"
Job,31,38,her I have guided from my mother’s womb);
Job,31,39,"if I have seen any perish for want of clothing,"
Job,31,40,or that the needy had no covering;
Job,31,41,"if his heart hasn’t blessed me,"
Job,31,42,if he hasn’t been warmed with my sheep’s fleece;
Job,31,43,"if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless,"
Job,31,44,"because I saw my help in the gate,"
Job,31,45,"then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder blade,"
Job,31,46,and my arm be broken from the bone.
Job,31,47,For calamity from God is a terror to me.
Job,31,48,"Because his majesty, I can do nothing."
Job,31,49,"“If I have made gold my hope,"
Job,31,50,"and have said to the fine gold, ‘You are my confidence;’"
Job,31,51,"If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great,"
Job,31,52,and because my hand had gotten much;
Job,31,53,"if I have seen the sun when it shined,"
Job,31,54,"or the moon moving in splendor,"
Job,31,55,"and my heart has been secretly enticed,"
Job,31,56,"and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth,"
Job,31,57,this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges;
Job,31,58,for I should have denied the God who is above.
Job,31,59,"“If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me,"
Job,31,60,or lifted up myself when evil found him
Job,31,61,"(yes, I have not allowed my mouth to sin"
Job,31,62,by asking his life with a curse);
Job,31,63,"if the men of my tent have not said,"
Job,31,64,‘Who can find one who has not been filled with his meat?’
Job,31,65,"(the foreigner has not camped in the street,"
Job,31,66,but I have opened my doors to the traveler);
Job,31,67,"if like Adam I have covered my transgressions,"
Job,31,68,"by hiding my iniquity in my heart,"
Job,31,69,"because I feared the great multitude,"
Job,31,70,"and the contempt of families terrified me,"
Job,31,71,"so that I kept silence, and didn’t go out of the door—"
Job,31,72,oh that I had one to hear me!
Job,31,73,"Behold, here is my signature! Let the Almighty answer me!"
Job,31,74,Let the accuser write my indictment!
Job,31,75,Surely I would carry it on my shoulder;
Job,31,76,and I would bind it to me as a crown.
Job,31,77,I would declare to him the number of my steps.
Job,31,78,as a prince would I go near to him.
Job,31,79,"If my land cries out against me,"
Job,31,80,and its furrows weep together;
Job,31,81,"if I have eaten its fruits without money,"
Job,31,82,"or have caused its owners to lose their life,"
Job,31,83,"let briers grow instead of wheat,"
Job,31,84,and stinkweed instead of barley.”
Job,31,85,The words of Job are ended.
Job,31,86,
Job,32,1,"So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes."
Job,32,2,"Then the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel, the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was kindled against Job. His wrath was kindled because he justified himself rather than God."
Job,32,3,"Also his wrath was kindled against his three friends, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job."
Job,32,4,"Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job, because they were elder than he."
Job,32,5,"When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled."
Job,32,6,"Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered,"
Job,32,7,"“I am young, and you are very old;"
Job,32,8,"Therefore I held back, and didn’t dare show you my opinion."
Job,32,9,"I said, ‘Days should speak,"
Job,32,10,and multitude of years should teach wisdom.’
Job,32,11,"But there is a spirit in man,"
Job,32,12,and the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding.
Job,32,13,"It is not the great who are wise,"
Job,32,14,nor the aged who understand justice.
Job,32,15,"Therefore I said, ‘Listen to me;"
Job,32,16,I also will show my opinion.’
Job,32,17,"“Behold, I waited for your words,"
Job,32,18,"and I listened for your reasoning,"
Job,32,19,while you searched out what to say.
Job,32,20,"Yes, I gave you my full attention,"
Job,32,21,"but there was no one who convinced Job,"
Job,32,22,"or who answered his words, among you."
Job,32,23,"Beware lest you say, ‘We have found wisdom,"
Job,32,24,"God may refute him, not man;’"
Job,32,25,for he has not directed his words against me;
Job,32,26,neither will I answer him with your speeches.
Job,32,27,“They are amazed. They answer no more.
Job,32,28,They don’t have a word to say.
Job,32,29,"Shall I wait, because they don’t speak,"
Job,32,30,"because they stand still, and answer no more?"
Job,32,31,"I also will answer my part,"
Job,32,32,and I also will show my opinion.
Job,32,33,For I am full of words.
Job,32,34,The spirit within me constrains me.
Job,32,35,"Behold, my breast is as wine which has no vent;"
Job,32,36,like new wineskins it is ready to burst.
Job,32,37,"I will speak, that I may be refreshed."
Job,32,38,I will open my lips and answer.
Job,32,39,"Please don’t let me respect any man’s person,"
Job,32,40,neither will I give flattering titles to any man.
Job,32,41,For I don’t know how to give flattering titles;
Job,32,42,or else my Maker would soon take me away.
Job,32,43,
Job,33,1,"“However, Job, please hear my speech,"
Job,33,2,and listen to all my words.
Job,33,3,"See now, I have opened my mouth."
Job,33,4,My tongue has spoken in my mouth.
Job,33,5,My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart.
Job,33,6,That which my lips know they shall speak sincerely.
Job,33,7,"The Spirit of God has made me,"
Job,33,8,and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
Job,33,9,"If you can, answer me."
Job,33,10,"Set your words in order before me, and stand up."
Job,33,11,"Behold, I am toward God even as you are."
Job,33,12,I am also formed out of the clay.
Job,33,13,"Behold, my terror shall not make you afraid,"
Job,33,14,neither shall my pressure be heavy on you.
Job,33,15,"“Surely you have spoken in my hearing,"
Job,33,16,"I have heard the voice of your words, saying,"
Job,33,17,"‘I am clean, without disobedience."
Job,33,18,"I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me."
Job,33,19,"Behold, he finds occasions against me."
Job,33,20,He counts me for his enemy.
Job,33,21,He puts my feet in the stocks.
Job,33,22,He marks all my paths.’
Job,33,23,"“Behold, I will answer you. In this you are not just,"
Job,33,24,for God is greater than man.
Job,33,25,"Why do you strive against him,"
Job,33,26,because he doesn’t give account of any of his matters?
Job,33,27,"For God speaks once,"
Job,33,28,"yes twice, though man pays no attention."
Job,33,29,"In a dream, in a vision of the night,"
Job,33,30,"when deep sleep falls on men,"
Job,33,31,in slumbering on the bed;
Job,33,32,"Then he opens the ears of men,"
Job,33,33,"and seals their instruction,"
Job,33,34,"That he may withdraw man from his purpose,"
Job,33,35,and hide pride from man.
Job,33,36,"He keeps back his soul from the pit,"
Job,33,37,and his life from perishing by the sword.
Job,33,38,"He is chastened also with pain on his bed,"
Job,33,39,with continual strife in his bones;
Job,33,40,"So that his life abhors bread,"
Job,33,41,and his soul dainty food.
Job,33,42,"His flesh is so consumed away, that it can’t be seen."
Job,33,43,His bones that were not seen stick out.
Job,33,44,"Yes, his soul draws near to the pit,"
Job,33,45,and his life to the destroyers.
Job,33,46,"“If there is beside him an angel,"
Job,33,47,"an interpreter, one among a thousand,"
Job,33,48,to show to man what is right for him;
Job,33,49,"then God is gracious to him, and says,"
Job,33,50,"‘Deliver him from going down to the pit,"
Job,33,51,I have found a ransom.’
Job,33,52,His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s.
Job,33,53,He returns to the days of his youth.
Job,33,54,"He prays to God, and he is favorable to him,"
Job,33,55,so that he sees his face with joy.
Job,33,56,He restores to man his righteousness.
Job,33,57,"He sings before men, and says,"
Job,33,58,"‘I have sinned, and perverted that which was right,"
Job,33,59,and it didn’t profit me.
Job,33,60,He has redeemed my soul from going into the pit.
Job,33,61,My life shall see the light.’
Job,33,62,"“Behold, God does all these things,"
Job,33,63,"twice, yes three times, with a man,"
Job,33,64,"to bring back his soul from the pit,"
Job,33,65,that he may be enlightened with the light of the living.
Job,33,66,"Mark well, Job, and listen to me."
Job,33,67,"Hold your peace, and I will speak."
Job,33,68,"If you have anything to say, answer me."
Job,33,69,"Speak, for I desire to justify you."
Job,33,70,"If not, listen to me."
Job,33,71,"Hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom.”"
Job,33,72,
Job,34,1,"Moreover Elihu answered,"
Job,34,2,"“Hear my words, you wise men."
Job,34,3,"Give ear to me, you who have knowledge."
Job,34,4,"For the ear tries words,"
Job,34,5,as the palate tastes food.
Job,34,6,Let us choose for us that which is right.
Job,34,7,Let us know among ourselves what is good.
Job,34,8,"For Job has said, ‘I am righteous,"
Job,34,9,God has taken away my right:
Job,34,10,Notwithstanding my right I am considered a liar.
Job,34,11,"My wound is incurable, though I am without disobedience.’"
Job,34,12,"What man is like Job,"
Job,34,13,"who drinks scorn like water,"
Job,34,14,"Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity,"
Job,34,15,and walks with wicked men?
Job,34,16,"For he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing"
Job,34,17,that he should delight himself with God.’
Job,34,18,"“Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding:"
Job,34,19,"far be it from God, that he should do wickedness,"
Job,34,20,"from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity."
Job,34,21,"For the work of a man he will render to him,"
Job,34,22,and cause every man to find according to his ways.
Job,34,23,"Yes surely, God will not do wickedly,"
Job,34,24,neither will the Almighty pervert justice.
Job,34,25,Who put him in charge of the earth?
Job,34,26,or who has appointed him over the whole world?
Job,34,27,"If he set his heart on himself,"
Job,34,28,"If he gathered to himself his spirit and his breath,"
Job,34,29,"all flesh would perish together,"
Job,34,30,and man would turn again to dust.
Job,34,31,"“If now you have understanding, hear this."
Job,34,32,Listen to the voice of my words.
Job,34,33,Shall even one who hates justice govern?
Job,34,34,Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty?—
Job,34,35,"Who says to a king, ‘Vile!’"
Job,34,36,"or to nobles, ‘Wicked!’?"
Job,34,37,"Who doesn’t respect the persons of princes,"
Job,34,38,nor respects the rich more than the poor;
Job,34,39,for they all are the work of his hands.
Job,34,40,"In a moment they die, even at midnight."
Job,34,41,The people are shaken and pass away.
Job,34,42,The mighty are taken away without a hand.
Job,34,43,“For his eyes are on the ways of a man.
Job,34,44,He sees all his goings.
Job,34,45,"There is no darkness, nor thick gloom,"
Job,34,46,where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
Job,34,47,"For he doesn’t need to consider a man further,"
Job,34,48,that he should go before God in judgment.
Job,34,49,"He breaks in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out,"
Job,34,50,and sets others in their place.
Job,34,51,Therefore he takes knowledge of their works.
Job,34,52,"He overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed."
Job,34,53,He strikes them as wicked men
Job,34,54,in the open sight of others;
Job,34,55,"because they turned away from following him,"
Job,34,56,"and wouldn’t pay attention to any of his ways,"
Job,34,57,so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him.
Job,34,58,He heard the cry of the afflicted.
Job,34,59,"When he gives quietness, who then can condemn?"
Job,34,60,"When he hides his face, who then can see him?"
Job,34,61,"Alike whether to a nation, or to a man,"
Job,34,62,"that the godless man may not reign,"
Job,34,63,that there be no one to ensnare the people.
Job,34,64,"“For has any said to God,"
Job,34,65,"‘I am guilty, but I will not offend any more."
Job,34,66,Teach me that which I don’t see.
Job,34,67,"If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more’?"
Job,34,68,"Shall his recompense be as you desire, that you refuse it?"
Job,34,69,"For you must choose, and not I."
Job,34,70,Therefore speak what you know.
Job,34,71,"Men of understanding will tell me,"
Job,34,72,"yes, every wise man who hears me:"
Job,34,73,‘Job speaks without knowledge.
Job,34,74,His words are without wisdom.’
Job,34,75,"I wish that Job were tried to the end,"
Job,34,76,because of his answering like wicked men.
Job,34,77,For he adds rebellion to his sin.
Job,34,78,"He claps his hands among us,"
Job,34,79,and multiplies his words against God.”
Job,34,80,
Job,36,1,"Elihu also continued, and said,"
Job,36,2,"“Bear with me a little, and I will show you;"
Job,36,3,for I still have something to say on God’s behalf.
Job,36,4,"I will get my knowledge from afar,"
Job,36,5,and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
Job,36,6,For truly my words are not false.
Job,36,7,One who is perfect in knowledge is with you.
Job,36,8,"“Behold, God is mighty, and doesn’t despise anyone."
Job,36,9,He is mighty in strength of understanding.
Job,36,10,"He doesn’t preserve the life of the wicked,"
Job,36,11,but gives to the afflicted their right.
Job,36,12,"He doesn’t withdraw his eyes from the righteous,"
Job,36,13,"but with kings on the throne,"
Job,36,14,"he sets them forever, and they are exalted."
Job,36,15,"If they are bound in fetters,"
Job,36,16,"and are taken in the cords of afflictions,"
Job,36,17,"then he shows them their work,"
Job,36,18,"and their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly."
Job,36,19,"He also opens their ears to instruction,"
Job,36,20,and commands that they return from iniquity.
Job,36,21,"If they listen and serve him,"
Job,36,22,"they shall spend their days in prosperity,"
Job,36,23,and their years in pleasures.
Job,36,24,"But if they don’t listen, they shall perish by the sword;"
Job,36,25,they shall die without knowledge.
Job,36,26,“But those who are godless in heart lay up anger.
Job,36,27,They don’t cry for help when he binds them.
Job,36,28,They die in youth.
Job,36,29,Their life perishes among the unclean.
Job,36,30,"He delivers the afflicted by their affliction,"
Job,36,31,and opens their ear in oppression.
Job,36,32,"Yes, he would have allured you out of distress,"
Job,36,33,"into a wide place, where there is no restriction."
Job,36,34,That which is set on your table would be full of fatness.
Job,36,35,“But you are full of the judgment of the wicked.
Job,36,36,Judgment and justice take hold of you.
Job,36,37,"Don’t let riches entice you to wrath,"
Job,36,38,neither let the great size of a bribe turn you aside.
Job,36,39,"Would your wealth sustain you in distress,"
Job,36,40,or all the might of your strength?
Job,36,41,"Don’t desire the night,"
Job,36,42,when people are cut off in their place.
Job,36,43,"Take heed, don’t regard iniquity;"
Job,36,44,for you have chosen this rather than affliction.
Job,36,45,"Behold, God is exalted in his power."
Job,36,46,Who is a teacher like him?
Job,36,47,Who has prescribed his way for him?
Job,36,48,"Or who can say, ‘You have committed unrighteousness?’"
Job,36,49,"“Remember that you magnify his work,"
Job,36,50,whereof men have sung.
Job,36,51,All men have looked on it.
Job,36,52,Man sees it afar off.
Job,36,53,"Behold, God is great, and we don’t know him."
Job,36,54,The number of his years is unsearchable.
Job,36,55,"For he draws up the drops of water,"
Job,36,56,"which distill in rain from his vapor,"
Job,36,57,Which the skies pour down
Job,36,58,and which drop on man abundantly.
Job,36,59,"Yes, can any understand the spreading of the clouds,"
Job,36,60,and the thunderings of his pavilion?
Job,36,61,"Behold, he spreads his light around him."
Job,36,62,He covers the bottom of the sea.
Job,36,63,For by these he judges the people.
Job,36,64,He gives food in abundance.
Job,36,65,"He covers his hands with the lightning,"
Job,36,66,and commands it to strike the mark.
Job,36,67,"Its noise tells about him,"
Job,36,68,and the livestock also concerning the storm that comes up.
Job,36,69,
Job,37,1,"“Yes, at this my heart trembles,"
Job,37,2,and is moved out of its place.
Job,37,3,"Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice,"
Job,37,4,the sound that goes out of his mouth.
Job,37,5,"He sends it out under the whole sky,"
Job,37,6,and his lightning to the ends of the earth.
Job,37,7,After it a voice roars.
Job,37,8,He thunders with the voice of his majesty.
Job,37,9,He doesn’t hold back anything when his voice is heard.
Job,37,10,God thunders marvelously with his voice.
Job,37,11,"He does great things, which we can’t comprehend."
Job,37,12,"For he says to the snow, ‘Fall on the earth;’"
Job,37,13,"likewise to the shower of rain,"
Job,37,14,and to the showers of his mighty rain.
Job,37,15,"He seals up the hand of every man,"
Job,37,16,that all men whom he has made may know it.
Job,37,17,"Then the animals take cover,"
Job,37,18,and remain in their dens.
Job,37,19,"Out of its room comes the storm,"
Job,37,20,and cold out of the north.
Job,37,21,"By the breath of God, ice is given,"
Job,37,22,and the width of the waters is frozen.
Job,37,23,"Yes, he loads the thick cloud with moisture."
Job,37,24,He spreads abroad the cloud of his lightning.
Job,37,25,"It is turned around by his guidance,"
Job,37,26,that they may do whatever he commands them
Job,37,27,"on the surface of the habitable world,"
Job,37,28,"Whether it is for correction, or for his land,"
Job,37,29,"or for loving kindness, that he causes it to come."
Job,37,30,"“Listen to this, Job."
Job,37,31,"Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God."
Job,37,32,"Do you know how God controls them,"
Job,37,33,and causes the lightning of his cloud to shine?
Job,37,34,"Do you know the workings of the clouds,"
Job,37,35,the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?
Job,37,36,"You whose clothing is warm,"
Job,37,37,when the earth is still by reason of the south wind?
Job,37,38,"Can you, with him, spread out the sky,"
Job,37,39,which is strong as a cast metal mirror?
Job,37,40,"Teach us what we shall tell him,"
Job,37,41,for we can’t make our case by reason of darkness.
Job,37,42,Will it be told him that I would speak?
Job,37,43,Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?
Job,37,44,"Now men don’t see the light which is bright in the skies,"
Job,37,45,"but the wind passes, and clears them."
Job,37,46,Out of the north comes golden splendor.
Job,37,47,With God is awesome majesty.
Job,37,48,We can’t reach the Almighty.
Job,37,49,He is exalted in power.
Job,37,50,"In justice and great righteousness, he will not oppress."
Job,37,51,Therefore men revere him.
Job,37,52,He doesn’t regard any who are wise of heart.”
Job,37,53,
Job,38,1,"Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind,"
Job,38,2,“Who is this who darkens counsel
Job,38,3,by words without knowledge?
Job,38,4,"Brace yourself like a man,"
Job,38,5,"for I will question you, then you answer me!"
Job,38,6,“Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?
Job,38,7,"Declare, if you have understanding."
Job,38,8,"Who determined its measures, if you know?"
Job,38,9,Or who stretched the line on it?
Job,38,10,Whereupon were its foundations fastened?
Job,38,11,"Or who laid its cornerstone,"
Job,38,12,"when the morning stars sang together,"
Job,38,13,and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
Job,38,14,"“Or who shut up the sea with doors,"
Job,38,15,"when it broke out of the womb,"
Job,38,16,"when I made clouds its garment,"
Job,38,17,"and wrapped it in thick darkness,"
Job,38,18,"marked out for it my bound,"
Job,38,19,"set bars and doors,"
Job,38,20,"and said, ‘Here you may come, but no further."
Job,38,21,Here your proud waves shall be stayed?’
Job,38,22,"“Have you commanded the morning in your days,"
Job,38,23,and caused the dawn to know its place;
Job,38,24,"that it might take hold of the ends of the earth,"
Job,38,25,and shake the wicked out of it?
Job,38,26,"It is changed as clay under the seal,"
Job,38,27,and presented as a garment.
Job,38,28,"From the wicked, their light is withheld."
Job,38,29,The high arm is broken.
Job,38,30,“Have you entered into the springs of the sea?
Job,38,31,Or have you walked in the recesses of the deep?
Job,38,32,Have the gates of death been revealed to you?
Job,38,33,Or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?
Job,38,34,Have you comprehended the earth in its width?
Job,38,35,"Declare, if you know it all."
Job,38,36,“What is the way to the dwelling of light?
Job,38,37,"As for darkness, where is its place,"
Job,38,38,"that you should take it to its bound,"
Job,38,39,that you should discern the paths to its house?
Job,38,40,"Surely you know, for you were born then,"
Job,38,41,and the number of your days is great!
Job,38,42,"Have you entered the treasuries of the snow,"
Job,38,43,"or have you seen the treasures of the hail,"
Job,38,44,"which I have reserved against the time of trouble,"
Job,38,45,against the day of battle and war?
Job,38,46,"By what way is the lightning distributed,"
Job,38,47,or the east wind scattered on the earth?
Job,38,48,"Who has cut a channel for the flood water,"
Job,38,49,or the path for the thunderstorm;
Job,38,50,To cause it to rain on a land where no man is;
Job,38,51,"on the wilderness, in which there is no man;"
Job,38,52,"to satisfy the waste and desolate ground,"
Job,38,53,to cause the tender grass to grow?
Job,38,54,Does the rain have a father?
Job,38,55,Or who fathers the drops of dew?
Job,38,56,Out of whose womb came the ice?
Job,38,57,"The gray frost of the sky, who has given birth to it?"
Job,38,58,"The waters become hard like stone,"
Job,38,59,when the surface of the deep is frozen.
Job,38,60,"“Can you bind the cluster of the Pleiades,"
Job,38,61,or loosen the cords of Orion?
Job,38,62,Can you lead the constellations out in their season?
Job,38,63,Or can you guide the Bear with her cubs?
Job,38,64,Do you know the laws of the heavens?
Job,38,65,Can you establish its dominion over the earth?
Job,38,66,"“Can you lift up your voice to the clouds,"
Job,38,67,That abundance of waters may cover you?
Job,38,68,"Can you send out lightnings, that they may go?"
Job,38,69,"Do they report to you, ‘Here we are?’"
Job,38,70,Who has put wisdom in the inward parts?
Job,38,71,Or who has given understanding to the mind?
Job,38,72,Who can count the clouds by wisdom?
Job,38,73,"Or who can pour out the bottles of the sky,"
Job,38,74,"when the dust runs into a mass,"
Job,38,75,and the clods of earth stick together?
Job,38,76,"“Can you hunt the prey for the lioness,"
Job,38,77,"or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,"
Job,38,78,"when they crouch in their dens,"
Job,38,79,and lie in wait in the thicket?
Job,38,80,"Who provides for the raven his prey,"
Job,38,81,"when his young ones cry to God,"
Job,38,82,and wander for lack of food?
Job,38,83,
Job,39,1,“Do you know the time when the mountain goats give birth?
Job,39,2,Do you watch when the doe bears fawns?
Job,39,3,Can you count the months that they fulfill?
Job,39,4,Or do you know the time when they give birth?
Job,39,5,"They bow themselves, they bear their young."
Job,39,6,They end their labor pains.
Job,39,7,Their young ones become strong.
Job,39,8,They grow up in the open field.
Job,39,9,"They go out, and don’t return again."
Job,39,10,“Who has set the wild donkey free?
Job,39,11,"Or who has loosened the bonds of the swift donkey,"
Job,39,12,"Whose home I have made the wilderness,"
Job,39,13,and the salt land his dwelling place?
Job,39,14,"He scorns the tumult of the city,"
Job,39,15,neither does he hear the shouting of the driver.
Job,39,16,"The range of the mountains is his pasture,"
Job,39,17,He searches after every green thing.
Job,39,18,“Will the wild ox be content to serve you?
Job,39,19,Or will he stay by your feeding trough?
Job,39,20,Can you hold the wild ox in the furrow with his harness?
Job,39,21,Or will he till the valleys after you?
Job,39,22,"Will you trust him, because his strength is great?"
Job,39,23,Or will you leave to him your labor?
Job,39,24,"Will you confide in him, that he will bring home your seed,"
Job,39,25,and gather the grain of your threshing floor?
Job,39,26,“The wings of the ostrich wave proudly;
Job,39,27,but are they the feathers and plumage of love?
Job,39,28,"For she leaves her eggs on the earth,"
Job,39,29,"warms them in the dust,"
Job,39,30,"and forgets that the foot may crush them,"
Job,39,31,or that the wild animal may trample them.
Job,39,32,"She deals harshly with her young ones, as if they were not hers."
Job,39,33,"Though her labor is in vain, she is without fear,"
Job,39,34,"because God has deprived her of wisdom,"
Job,39,35,neither has he imparted to her understanding.
Job,39,36,"When she lifts up herself on high,"
Job,39,37,she scorns the horse and his rider.
Job,39,38,“Have you given the horse might?
Job,39,39,Have you clothed his neck with a quivering mane?
Job,39,40,Have you made him to leap as a locust?
Job,39,41,The glory of his snorting is awesome.
Job,39,42,"He paws in the valley, and rejoices in his strength."
Job,39,43,He goes out to meet the armed men.
Job,39,44,"He mocks at fear, and is not dismayed,"
Job,39,45,neither does he turn back from the sword.
Job,39,46,"The quiver rattles against him,"
Job,39,47,the flashing spear and the javelin.
Job,39,48,"He eats up the ground with fierceness and rage,"
Job,39,49,neither does he stand still at the sound of the trumpet.
Job,39,50,"As often as the trumpet sounds he snorts, ‘Aha!’"
Job,39,51,"He smells the battle afar off,"
Job,39,52,"the thunder of the captains, and the shouting."
Job,39,53,"“Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars,"
Job,39,54,and stretches her wings toward the south?
Job,39,55,"Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up,"
Job,39,56,and makes his nest on high?
Job,39,57,"On the cliff he dwells, and makes his home,"
Job,39,58,"on the point of the cliff, and the stronghold."
Job,39,59,From there he spies out the prey.
Job,39,60,His eyes see it afar off.
Job,39,61,His young ones also suck up blood.
Job,39,62,"Where the slain are, there he is.”"
Job,39,63,
Job,40,1,"Moreover Yahweh answered Job,"
Job,40,2,“Shall he who argues contend with the Almighty?
Job,40,3,"He who argues with God, let him answer it.”"
Job,40,4,"Then Job answered Yahweh,"
Job,40,5,"“Behold, I am of small account. What shall I answer you?"
Job,40,6,I lay my hand on my mouth.
Job,40,7,"I have spoken once, and I will not answer;"
Job,40,8,"Yes, twice, but I will proceed no further.”"
Job,40,9,"Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind,"
Job,40,10,“Now brace yourself like a man.
Job,40,11,"I will question you, and you will answer me."
Job,40,12,Will you even annul my judgment?
Job,40,13,"Will you condemn me, that you may be justified?"
Job,40,14,Or do you have an arm like God?
Job,40,15,Can you thunder with a voice like him?
Job,40,16,“Now deck yourself with excellency and dignity.
Job,40,17,Array yourself with honor and majesty.
Job,40,18,Pour out the fury of your anger.
Job,40,19,"Look at everyone who is proud, and bring him low."
Job,40,20,"Look at everyone who is proud, and humble him."
Job,40,21,Crush the wicked in their place.
Job,40,22,Hide them in the dust together.
Job,40,23,Bind their faces in the hidden place.
Job,40,24,Then I will also admit to you
Job,40,25,that your own right hand can save you.
Job,40,26,"“See now, behemoth, which I made as well as you."
Job,40,27,He eats grass as an ox.
Job,40,28,"Look now, his strength is in his thighs."
Job,40,29,His force is in the muscles of his belly.
Job,40,30,He moves his tail like a cedar.
Job,40,31,The sinews of his thighs are knit together.
Job,40,32,His bones are like tubes of brass.
Job,40,33,His limbs are like bars of iron.
Job,40,34,He is the chief of the ways of God.
Job,40,35,He who made him gives him his sword.
Job,40,36,"Surely the mountains produce food for him,"
Job,40,37,where all the animals of the field play.
Job,40,38,"He lies under the lotus trees,"
Job,40,39,"in the covert of the reed, and the marsh."
Job,40,40,The lotuses cover him with their shade.
Job,40,41,The willows of the brook surround him.
Job,40,42,"Behold, if a river overflows, he doesn’t tremble."
Job,40,43,"He is confident, though the Jordan swells even to his mouth."
Job,40,44,"Shall any take him when he is on the watch,"
Job,40,45,or pierce through his nose with a snare?
Job,40,46,
Job,41,1,"“Can you draw out Leviathan with a fish hook,"
Job,41,2,or press down his tongue with a cord?
Job,41,3,"Can you put a rope into his nose,"
Job,41,4,or pierce his jaw through with a hook?
Job,41,5,"Will he make many petitions to you,"
Job,41,6,or will he speak soft words to you?
Job,41,7,"Will he make a covenant with you,"
Job,41,8,that you should take him for a servant forever?
Job,41,9,Will you play with him as with a bird?
Job,41,10,Or will you bind him for your girls?
Job,41,11,Will traders barter for him?
Job,41,12,Will they part him among the merchants?
Job,41,13,"Can you fill his skin with barbed irons,"
Job,41,14,or his head with fish spears?
Job,41,15,Lay your hand on him.
Job,41,16,"Remember the battle, and do so no more."
Job,41,17,"Behold, the hope of him is in vain."
Job,41,18,Won’t one be cast down even at the sight of him?
Job,41,19,None is so fierce that he dare stir him up.
Job,41,20,Who then is he who can stand before me?
Job,41,21,"Who has first given to me, that I should repay him?"
Job,41,22,Everything under the heavens is mine.
Job,41,23,"“I will not keep silence concerning his limbs,"
Job,41,24,"nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame."
Job,41,25,Who can strip off his outer garment?
Job,41,26,Who shall come within his jaws?
Job,41,27,Who can open the doors of his face?
Job,41,28,Around his teeth is terror.
Job,41,29,"Strong scales are his pride,"
Job,41,30,shut up together with a close seal.
Job,41,31,"One is so near to another,"
Job,41,32,that no air can come between them.
Job,41,33,They are joined to one another.
Job,41,34,"They stick together, so that they can’t be pulled apart."
Job,41,35,His sneezing flashes out light.
Job,41,36,His eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.
Job,41,37,Out of his mouth go burning torches.
Job,41,38,Sparks of fire leap out.
Job,41,39,"Out of his nostrils a smoke goes,"
Job,41,40,as of a boiling pot over a fire of reeds.
Job,41,41,His breath kindles coals.
Job,41,42,A flame goes out of his mouth.
Job,41,43,There is strength in his neck.
Job,41,44,Terror dances before him.
Job,41,45,The flakes of his flesh are joined together.
Job,41,46,They are firm on him.
Job,41,47,They can’t be moved.
Job,41,48,"His heart is as firm as a stone,"
Job,41,49,"yes, firm as the lower millstone."
Job,41,50,"When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid."
Job,41,51,They retreat before his thrashing.
Job,41,52,"If one attacks him with the sword, it can’t prevail;"
Job,41,53,"nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft."
Job,41,54,He counts iron as straw;
Job,41,55,and brass as rotten wood.
Job,41,56,The arrow can’t make him flee.
Job,41,57,Sling stones are like chaff to him.
Job,41,58,Clubs are counted as stubble.
Job,41,59,He laughs at the rushing of the javelin.

Job,41,61,leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge.

Job,41,63,He makes the sea like a pot of ointment.
Job,41,64,He makes a path shine after him.

Job,41,66,"On earth there is not his equal,"
Job,41,67,that is made without fear.
Job,41,68,He sees everything that is high.

Job,42,1,"Then Job answered Yahweh,"
Job,42,2,"“I know that you can do all things,"
Job,42,3,and that no purpose of yours can be restrained.
Job,42,4,"You asked, ‘Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge?’"
Job,42,5,"therefore I have uttered that which I did not understand,"
Job,42,6,"things too wonderful for me, which I didn’t know."
Job,42,7,"You said, ‘Listen, now, and I will speak;"
Job,42,8,"I will question you, and you will answer me.’"
Job,42,9,"I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear,"
Job,42,10,but now my eye sees you.
Job,42,11,"Therefore I abhor myself,"
Job,42,12,and repent in dust and ashes.”
Job,42,13,"It was so, that after Yahweh had spoken these words to Job, Yahweh said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “My wrath is kindled against you, and against your two friends; for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has."
Job,42,14,"Now therefore, take to yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept him, that I not deal with you according to your folly. For you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.”"
Job,42,15,"So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did what Yahweh commanded them, and Yahweh accepted Job."
Job,42,16,"Yahweh turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends. Yahweh gave Job twice as much as he had before."
Job,42,17,"Then came there to him all his brothers, and all his sisters, and all those who had been of his acquaintance before, and ate bread with him in his house. They comforted him, and consoled him concerning all the evil that Yahweh had brought on him. Everyone also gave him a piece of money, and everyone a ring of gold."
Job,42,18,"So Yahweh blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand female donkeys."
Job,42,19,He had also seven sons and three daughters.
Job,42,20,"He called the name of the first, Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren Happuch."
Job,42,21,In all the land were no women found so beautiful as the daughters of Job. Their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.
Job,42,22,"After this Job lived one hundred forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, to four generations."
Job,42,23,"So Job died, being old and full of days."

Psalms,2,15,Today I have become your father.

Psalms,77,13,the years of ancient times.
Psalms,77,14,I remember my song in the night.
Psalms,77,15,I consider in my own heart;
Psalms,77,16,my spirit diligently inquires:
Psalms,77,17,“Will the Lord reject us forever?
Psalms,77,18,Will he be favorable no more?
Psalms,77,19,Has his loving kindness vanished forever?

Psalms,78,8,"telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh,"
Psalms,78,9,"his strength, and his wondrous deeds that he has done."

Psalms,78,13,that they should make them known to their children;
Psalms,78,14,"that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born;"
Psalms,78,15,"who should arise and tell their children,"
Psalms,78,16,"that they might set their hope in God,"
Psalms,78,17,"and not forget God’s deeds,"
Psalms,78,18,"but keep his commandments,"
Psalms,78,19,"and might not be as their fathers,"
Psalms,78,20,"a stubborn and rebellious generation,"
Psalms,78,21,"a generation that didn’t make their hearts loyal,"
Psalms,78,22,whose spirit was not steadfast with God.
Psalms,78,23,"The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,"
Psalms,78,24,turned back in the day of battle.
Psalms,78,25,"They didn’t keep God’s covenant,"

Psalms,78,38,and caused waters to run down like rivers.
Psalms,78,39,"Yet they still went on to sin against him,"
Psalms,78,40,to rebel against the Most High in the desert.
Psalms,78,41,They tempted God in their heart
Psalms,78,42,by asking food according to their desire.
Psalms,78,43,"Yes, they spoke against God."
Psalms,78,44,"They said, “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?"
Psalms,78,45,"Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out,"
Psalms,78,46,and streams overflowed.
Psalms,78,47,Can he give bread also?
Psalms,78,48,Will he provide meat for his people?”
Psalms,78,49,"Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry."
Psalms,78,50,"A fire was kindled against Jacob,"
Psalms,78,51,"anger also went up against Israel,"
Psalms,78,52,"because they didn’t believe in God,"
Psalms,78,53,and didn’t trust in his salvation.
Psalms,78,54,"Yet he commanded the skies above,"
Psalms,78,55,and opened the doors of heaven.
Psalms,78,56,"He rained down manna on them to eat,"
Psalms,78,57,and gave them food from the sky.

Psalms,78,59,He sent them food to the full.
Psalms,78,60,He caused the east wind to blow in the sky.
Psalms,78,61,By his power he guided the south wind.

Psalms,78,63,winged birds as the sand of the seas.
Psalms,78,64,"He let them fall in the middle of their camp,"
Psalms,78,65,around their habitations.
Psalms,78,66,"So they ate, and were well filled."
Psalms,78,67,He gave them their own desire.
Psalms,78,68,They didn’t turn from their cravings.
Psalms,78,69,"Their food was yet in their mouths,"
Psalms,78,70,"when the anger of God went up against them,"
Psalms,78,71,"killed some of their fattest,"
Psalms,78,72,and struck down the young men of Israel.
Psalms,78,73,"For all this they still sinned,"
Psalms,78,74,and didn’t believe in his wondrous works.
Psalms,78,75,"Therefore he consumed their days in vanity,"
Psalms,78,76,and their years in terror.
Psalms,78,77,"When he killed them, then they inquired after him."
Psalms,78,78,They returned and sought God earnestly.
Psalms,78,79,"They remembered that God was their rock,"
Psalms,78,80,"the Most High God, their redeemer."
Psalms,78,81,"But they flattered him with their mouth,"
Psalms,78,82,and lied to him with their tongue.
Psalms,78,83,"For their heart was not right with him,"
Psalms,78,84,neither were they faithful in his covenant.
Psalms,78,85,"But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn’t destroy them."
Psalms,78,86,"Yes, many times he turned his anger away,"
Psalms,78,87,and didn’t stir up all his wrath.
Psalms,78,88,"He remembered that they were but flesh,"
Psalms,78,89,"a wind that passes away, and doesn’t come again."
Psalms,78,90,"How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,"
Psalms,78,91,and grieved him in the desert!
Psalms,78,92,"They turned again and tempted God,"
Psalms,78,93,and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
Psalms,78,94,"They didn’t remember his hand,"
Psalms,78,95,nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;
Psalms,78,96,"how he set his signs in Egypt,"
Psalms,78,97,"his wonders in the field of Zoan,"
Psalms,78,98,"he turned their rivers into blood,"
Psalms,78,99,"and their streams, so that they could not drink."
Psalms,78,100,"He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;"
Psalms,78,101,"and frogs, which destroyed them."
Psalms,78,102,"He gave also their increase to the caterpillar,"
Psalms,78,103,and their labor to the locust.
Psalms,78,104,"He destroyed their vines with hail,"
Psalms,78,105,their sycamore fig trees with frost.
Psalms,78,106,"He gave over their livestock also to the hail,"
Psalms,78,107,and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
Psalms,78,108,"He threw on them the fierceness of his anger,"
Psalms,78,109,"wrath, indignation, and trouble,"
Psalms,78,110,and a band of angels of evil.
Psalms,78,111,He made a path for his anger.
Psalms,78,112,"He didn’t spare their soul from death,"
Psalms,78,113,"but gave their life over to the pestilence,"
Psalms,78,114,"and struck all the firstborn in Egypt,"
Psalms,78,115,the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.
Psalms,78,116,"But he led out his own people like sheep,"
Psalms,78,117,and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
Psalms,78,118,"He led them safely, so that they weren’t afraid,"
Psalms,78,119,but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
Psalms,78,120,"He brought them to the border of his sanctuary,"
Psalms,78,121,"to this mountain, which his right hand had taken."
Psalms,78,122,"He also drove out the nations before them,"
Psalms,78,123,"allotted them for an inheritance by line,"
Psalms,78,124,and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
Psalms,78,125,"Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,"
Psalms,78,126,and didn’t keep his testimonies;
Psalms,78,127,"but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers."
Psalms,78,128,They were twisted like a deceitful bow.
Psalms,78,129,"For they provoked him to anger with their high places,"
Psalms,78,130,and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.
Psalms,78,131,"When God heard this, he was angry,"
Psalms,78,132,and greatly abhorred Israel;
Psalms,78,133,"So that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh,"
Psalms,78,134,the tent which he placed among men;
Psalms,78,135,"and delivered his strength into captivity,"
Psalms,78,136,his glory into the adversary’s hand.
Psalms,78,137,"He also gave his people over to the sword,"
Psalms,78,138,and was angry with his inheritance.
Psalms,78,139,Fire devoured their young men.
Psalms,78,140,Their virgins had no wedding song.
Psalms,78,141,"Their priests fell by the sword,"
Psalms,78,142,and their widows couldn’t weep.
Psalms,78,143,"Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep,"
Psalms,78,144,like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.
Psalms,78,145,He struck his adversaries backward.
Psalms,78,146,He put them to a perpetual reproach.
Psalms,78,147,"Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph,"
Psalms,78,148,"and didn’t choose the tribe of Ephraim,"
Psalms,78,149,"But chose the tribe of Judah,"
Psalms,78,150,Mount Zion which he loved.
Psalms,78,151,"He built his sanctuary like the heights,"
Psalms,78,152,like the earth which he has established forever.
Psalms,78,153,"He also chose David his servant,"
Psalms,78,154,and took him from the sheepfolds;
Psalms,78,155,"from following the ewes that have their young,"
Psalms,78,156,"he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people,"
Psalms,78,157,"and Israel, his inheritance."
Psalms,78,158,"So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart,"
Psalms,78,159,and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.
Psalms,78,160,
Psalms,79,1,"God, the nations have come into your inheritance."
Psalms,79,2,They have defiled your holy temple.
Psalms,79,3,They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.
Psalms,79,4,"They have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky,"
Psalms,79,5,the flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth.
Psalms,79,6,Their blood they have shed like water around Jerusalem.

Psalms,106,94,"Nevertheless he regarded their distress,"
Psalms,106,95,when he heard their cry.

Psalms,107,21,"being bound in affliction and iron,"
Psalms,107,22,"because they rebelled against the words of God,"
Psalms,107,23,and condemned the counsel of the Most High.
Psalms,107,24,Therefore he brought down their heart with labor.

Psalms,107,50,"For he commands, and raises the stormy wind,"
Psalms,107,51,which lifts up its waves.
Psalms,107,52,They mount up to the sky; they go down again to the depths.
Psalms,107,53,Their soul melts away because of trouble.
Psalms,107,54,"They reel back and forth, and stagger like a drunken man,"
Psalms,107,55,and are at their wits’ end.
Psalms,107,56,"Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble,"
